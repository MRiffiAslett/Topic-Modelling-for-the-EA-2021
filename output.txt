Only two of the Environment Agency’s areas - East Anglia and Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - now remain in “drought” status, with most now “recovering”.As of the beginning of February, total reservoir capacity across the country is at 88 percent. This compares with 49 percent at the end of September 2022, when reservoirs were at their lowest following the drought through summer.There has been a dry start to the month – with low rainfall across England since the end of January – meaning 63% of rivers are currently below normal levels for this time of year. Some storage reservoirs are still lower than anticipated and groundwater levels in Norfolk are only now beginning to rise slowly.The National Drought Group - made up of senior decision-makers from the Environment Agency, government, the Met Office, water companies and key farming and environmental groups - said that despite taking winter readiness actions, increasing output and undertaking network improvements over winter, further steady rainfall will be needed to ensure the nation’s water reservoirs are in a good position ahead of the warmer, drier, summer months. Rainfall over the next three months will be vital in reducing the drought risk for the summer.The natural environment continues to take time to recuperate from the impacts of last summer and the Environment Agency is also focusing ongoing efforts on monitoring how well fish and invertebrates are recovering from drought.Members are planning for the worst case scenario of another hot, dry spell this summer and are managing water resources to reduce the risk of drought measures - such as temporary use bans and taking additional water from the environment -  being required again this year.EA Executive Director and NDG chair John Leyland said:While most water levels have returned to normal across much of the country, low rainfall in recent weeks highlights the importance of remaining vigilant. We cannot rely on the weather alone, which is why the Environment Agency, water companies and our partners are taking action to ensure water resources are in the best possible position both for the summer and for future droughts.As ever, it is important that we all continue to use water carefully to protect not just our water resources; but our precious environment and the wildlife that depends on it.NDG members heard that:Water companies, retailers and regulators must learn from the response to the 2022 drought and take forward improvements for managing and responding to future droughts.Water companies have continued to maximise opportunities to improve their water supplies over winter; identifying new sources of water; ensuring sources are operating as they should be and reducing leakage. The Environment Agency have determined additional drought permits to help refill reservoirs and improve water supplies ahead of spring.The farming sector is working to improve drought resilience, to ensure water availability for the short and long term, helping overall food security. The Environment Agency is working closely with the Rural Payments Agency to ensure abstraction licences associated with reservoir grant applications are determined on time.All sectors are now undertaking precautionary planning in the event that hot, dry weather returns in the summer, and continue to work closely together to support water supplies across the country.England is experiencing more extreme weather more often. Over the last month, the Environment Agency has also been responding to flooding in parts of the country, following heavy rainfall over December and January.The Environment Agency is clear that planning for increasingly extreme weather is essential in order for everyone to be prepared for the impacts these events cause - both drought and flooding.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 10 February 2023Explore the topicDrought and water availabilityIs this page useful?

These abuses are estimated to cost the English economy £87.2 million a year.The government confirmed plans to close these loopholes in the Environmental Improvement Plan, which was published last week, alongside a pledge to seek to eliminate waste crime by 2043.The government proposes to remove three of the 10 waste exemptions of most concern, covering the use of depolluted end-of-life vehicle parts, the treatment of tyres, and the recovery of scrap metal. Illegal or improper activity that undermined legitimate operators and posed a risk to the environment and the public was particularly pronounced for these exemptions. The conditions of a further seven exemptions will also be tightened.Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said:Waste crime costs taxpayers tens of millions of pounds every year. We are determined to take the fight to those shameful criminals who seek to wreak havoc on our environment and economy.We are clear in our commitment to eliminate this kind of illegal activity and these reforms will prevent dishonest operators from gaming the system and putting our health at risk.This is just one of the measures we’re taking to tackle waste crime – we’re also giving regulators and local authorities more power to bring criminals to justice.Steve Molyneux, the Environment Agency’s strategic lead on Waste Regulation, said:The Environment Agency is determined to make life harder for criminals by disrupting and stopping illegal activity through better regulation and tough enforcement action.Today’s announcement will help us in our goal by restricting or removing waste exemptions that are used to mask illegal waste sites. These sites are a risk to the environment and people’s safety, and undercut legitimate business. We will keep working with Government and the waste industry to drive further action on waste crime.The Environment Agency’s regulatory compliance checks have revealed that certain exemption types have been routinely used to hide illegal waste activities from regulatory oversight in recent years.For instance, in November 2020 firefighters tackled a blaze for a week at a site in Bradford that held an exemption allowing the storage of tyres. The exemption was being abused and 600,000 tyres were on the site. The proposed reforms would mean a full environmental permit would be needed for this kind of site.The government is also planning to introduce greater record-keeping requirements for all waste exemption holders; impose limits and controls on how multiple exemptions can be managed at one site; and ban the use of exemptions at a site operating under an environmental permit, or where there is a ‘direct link’ between the exempt and permitted activity.This follows our consultation on proposals to tackle crime and poor performance in the waste sector.We recently consulted on reform of the carrier, broker, dealer regime, meaning increased background checks for firms moving or trading waste; and on the introduction of mandatory digital waste tracking, ensuring better record-keeping to help regulators detect waste crime.On top of this we are awarding councils with grants to tackle fly-tipping, and have provided funding of over £450,000 to help several councils purchase equipment to assist further, such as CCTV.The Environment Agency has today launched a National Waste Crime Survey to help stop criminals. They want to hear from victims of waste crime such as landowners, insurance companies and residents as well as from those who can provide important information such as industry.At present only 25% of waste crimes are reported. Don’t let the criminals get away with it. Report anything suspicious to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or our 24 hour incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 6 February 2023Explore the topicWaste managementIs this page useful?

The Environment Agency’s flood defence barriers at Hull, Boston, Ipswich and Thames will also be lit up at dusk on 31 January.EA FCRM Executive Director Caroline Douglass said:As we remember those who tragically lost their lives 70 years ago, this anniversary should serve as a reminder of the devastation flooding can cause to communities.We are far better prepared than we were back in 1953 with huge advances in forecasting, warning and defences – but extreme flooding could strike at any time and is only set to increase with a changing climate and rising sea levels.Being prepared for coastal flooding could save your family, possessions, and livelihood. People should check if they are at risk on the Environment Agency website, sign up for free flood warnings and make sure your property is resilient to flooding.Floods Minister Rebecca Pow said:Newsreel footage from the time shows the true devastation across the East of England for people, their homes, and businesses.The surge has left a lasting mark on communities even to this day and I hope we can all come together to remember and reflect upon this tragedy.I know first-hand the trauma a flood can cause. Investment in recent years along with our new record funding will go a long way to reassure people that communities right across the country are better protected.There have been many improvements in flood prevention since the East Coast Tidal Surge which mean that communities in England are much better protected now.In 1953, there was no flood warning system. Now, over 1.6 million people are signed up to receive flood warnings, giving them vital time to prepare. Long-lead flood forecasts have also been introduced, including the use of tide, wave and weather data, allowing businesses and emergency responders to prepare well in advance.The Environment Agency has since built key defences such as the state-of-the-art Thames Barrier which protects almost 1.5 million people from tidal flood risk, as well as improved sea defences in many areas across the country. Much of the investment in flood prevention has been focused upon areas where there was major loss of life in 1953.Met Office Head of Situational Awareness, Will Lang, said:Although the low-pressure storm system, the high tides and the resulting storm surge were forecast well in advance back in January 1953, many people along the east coast of the UK were just not prepared. Since that time much more effective warning systems have been developed.Storm surges still happen but these days warnings are more effectively and widely communicated and people are much more aware of the risks.Flood defences provide vital protection to many communities, but tidal surges still happen regularly along the coast and flooding events are happening more frequently due to climate change.Wet weather at the start of this year alone has caused flooding and travel disruption in parts of the country. While this has sadly led to the flooding of around 130 properties, over 5,000 properties have been protected across the West Midlands, Yorkshire, in the South West and along the Thames.Around 1.9 million homes are at risk of coastal flooding and parts of England’s coast are amongst the fastest eroding coastline in Europe. By 2100 once-a-century sea level events are set to become annual events.The Environment Agency is urging people to take three simple steps:check your flood risk onlinesign up for flood warningsknow what to do if flooding hitsThe EA is taking action to ensure that we are better protected against increasing extreme weather events. We have just completed a £2.6 billion programme with the government, better protecting 314,000 properties. Of this, £1.2 billion was invested to better protect around 200,000 homes from coastal erosion and sea flooding.The Government is also investing £200m for the Flood and Coastal Resilience Innovation programme to support local places including coastal communities. It includes the £36 million Coastal transition accelerators programme which will support communities in areas at significant risk of coastal erosion to transition and adapt to a changing climate.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 31 January 2023Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

One of the most senior voices on the environment in England, Sir James Bevan, has given a speech to University of East Anglia students. Sir James praised the institution’s ‘outstanding’ work on climate research.Sir James Bevan, Chief Executive of the Environment Agency, made the remarks in his speech at the UEA on 16 January. He highlighted the need to focus on tackling climate change, rather than letting fear and doom deter action.University of East Anglia was 1 of the early pioneers of climate research and has been producing world class analysis for nearly 50 years now. Both its Climatic Research Unit and the Tyndall Centre have both broken new ground in understanding our changing climate and how best to address those consequences. Sir James also referenced the scale of work yet to do within the research space and building international consensus on action.Sir James Bevan, Environment Agency Chief Executive, said:In my view this climate doomism is almost as dangerous as climate denial. Indeed doomism might even be the new denial. And it’s equally misplaced. It’s not justified by the facts. And it risks leading to the wrong outcome: inaction.He explained:We know what we have to do to solve the problem. The solutions are technically quite simple.First, we need to reduce and as far as possible stop entirely the emissions of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases: what the experts call mitigation.And second, we need to adapt our infrastructure, our economies and our lifestyles so we can live safely, sustainably and well in a climate-changed world.He later added:If we tackle the climate emergency right, and treat it not just as an existential risk but as a massive opportunity, we can actually build a better world.One in which we make cities which don’t just generate less carbon or which are just more resilient but are also better places to live. In which we invent new technologies that don’t just mitigate and adapt but also help nature recover from the battering we’ve given it and thrive.In which we find new ways to run successful economies so there is sustainable, inclusive growth for everyone.By ending the impacts of climate change on the weakest and helping them recover from things they did not cause, we help deliver justice for all.  UEA has worked with councils and partners to develop a 25-year environmental plan to mitigate the impact of climate change on water security and sea-level rise in region. The Climate Research Unit on UEA campus plays a leading role in producing global temperature figures.  The University’s Leverhulme PhD programme is training a new generation of 21st Century climate thought leaders.Prof Konstantinos Chalvatzis, Professor of Sustainable Energy Business and ClimateUEA Academic Director, said:I’m thrilled that ClimateUEA has hosted Sir James Bevan on our campus.His talk engaged on a range of topics and I am looking forward to exploring where UEA’s and the Environment Agency’s expertise can jointly address environmental challenges.During his speech Sir James referred to how the Environment Agency is playing a central part in tackling the climate emergency. He highlighted the 3 goals of the EA2025 strategy: a nation resilient to climate change; healthy air, land and water; and green growth and a sustainable future.Sir James concluded by saying the Environment Agency is always looking for talented people who are committed to creating a better planet. He invited attendees to consider joining the agency to help tackle the climate emergency.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 19 January 2023Explore the topicClimate change adaptationIs this page useful?

From:Environment AgencyPublished24 January 2023        The completed fish pass project in the River Derwent in Derbyshire.      Producing upwards of half a million fish each year, Calverton fish farm is the Environment Agency’s equivalent of an Amazon warehouse for fish restocking and is once again preparing for the fast approaching fish spawning season.Calverton’s work stocking fisheries across England is one of many projects up and down the country fully funded by fishing licence income. Today (Tuesday 24 January 2022) the Environment Agency’s fisheries annual report (Fisheries annual report 2021 to 2022 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)) reveals how nearly £22m in rod licence income – achieved through almost 935,000 fishing licence sales – has been spent during 2021 and 2022 to enhance and protect England’s fisheries.First opened in 1940, Calverton has gone on to become one of the largest freshwater fish rearing facilities in England, rearing nine freshwater species to boost fish stocks in rivers and stillwaters up and down the country. It also aides the recovery of fish populations after pollution events, rears threatened species such as the crucian carp, and supports fisheries research and development.Over the last year, the EA has worked with over 1000 partners including The Angling Trust, The Wild Trout Trust and the Institute of Fisheries Management to improve fish stocks and habitats, provide new facilities for anglers and make fisheries more accessible.Funded by EA fishing licence income, the Angling Trust launched two new campaigns in 2022, including the ‘Get Fishing for Wellbeing’ and ‘We Fish as one’ projects offering advice to the public on how to start fishing and find mental health support near them; and encouraging people from all backgrounds to take up fishing.Heidi Stone, Environment Agency Fisheries Manager said:Our annual report is our summary to you to show where we spent the money we receive. From improving fish habitats, to controlling threats from non-native species right through to making fishing more accessible, the EA has carried out some fantastic projects this year that will improve our fisheries and benefit anglers around the country.These are key examples of how we inject income from fishing licence fees directly back into fisheries - and I want to thank anglers for continuing to play their part and allowing us to invest in projects to help our environment flourish.In 2022, more than 50 projects were completed through the Angling Improvement Fund (AIF) – funded by EA rod licence income - with many of these funding biosecurity measures to protect fisheries from predators such as otters and cormorants. In particular, Top Farm fishery in Worcester was suffering from serious predation caused by cormorants as well as grebes, and a survey revealed that they were incurring substantial silver fish losses. Through the AIF, the fishery was granted over £2000 towards the cost of 6 floating islands that have provided fish protection and cover, enabling stocks to thrive once again.Over the last year, 30 fish passes were built and 16 weirs and barriers removed to support valuable fish stocks. The River Derwent in Derbyshire, for example, has seen fish populations steadily improving thanks to the EA’s work in removing Snake Lane Weir, completed in October 2022 with support from The Wild Trout Trust as part of the EA’s Water Environment Investment Fund (WEIF). Having barred access upstream for fish for centuries, this project has opened up a further 9km of habitat for all fish including Atlantic Salmon – helping to transform the river and its ecosystem.The EA enforcement teams continue to make sure anglers comply with regulations to protect fish stock. In 2021 to 2022, fisheries enforcement officers checked just over 41,000 fishing licences and successfully prosecuted nearly 730 anglers for fishing without a licence. You must purchase a fishing licence to fish in England and Wales. Annual licences start from £30 and can be purchased online or by phone, more information can be found here: Buy a rod fishing licence: When you need a licence - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 24 January 2023Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityWildlife, animals, biodiversity and ecosystemsIs this page useful?

The current order prevents access to the site, except for the purpose of removing waste, and waste cannot be imported or processed onsite.Jacqui Tootill, South Yorkshire Area Environment Manager at the Environment Agency said:Our officers have already taken enforcement action to issue a restriction order for this site – preventing any further waste from being dumped or treated there and ensuring that the operator can only access the site in order to remove waste.We are inspecting the site regularly and continuing to work with partners to ensure this order is followed and also working to ensure the site is cleared. We will take further enforcement action if necessary and continue to investigate the alleged offending linked to the activities at this site.The Court heard from an Environment Agency Environmental Crime Officer and an Officer of South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue that the condition of the site was such that it posed a risk of serious pollution to the environment and serious harm to human health, and a restriction order was necessary.The Environment Agency is working alongside South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service in the ongoing criminal investigation into activities at the site.When using a skip hire company, businesses and householders have a duty to check they are registered waste carriers and that their waste is being taken to a permitted facility.

Investigators believe the Ford tipper truck belonged to a group operating at various sites in the capital. Crime officers removed the vehicle from an address at Chesham in Buckinghamshire during a wider probe into organised waste crime.The 18-year white van had been seen reportedly dumping waste on open land, in empty warehouses and other sites in Croydon, Merton, Mitcham and Southwark in the past year. Material left at the sites included construction waste, tyres and rubbish from house clearances.Officers continue to investigate the vehicle’s owners, who failed to come forward to claim it before it was destroyed.Matt Higginson, an Environment Manager for the Environment Agency in the South East, said:Where individuals threaten to undermine legitimate businesses and illegally dump waste, we have no hesitation in using all powers open to us.Seizing vehicles involved in waste crime, based upon vital intelligence from the public, is an important weapon in our armoury to disrupt waste criminals and can make a real difference to local communities blighted by illegal dumping of waste.To avoid unwittingly supporting waste criminals, and facing the possibility of an unlimited fine, we ask the public and businesses to always ask for proof of a waste carrier’s registration and waste transfer note - and take photos of them – before having any waste cleared.Crushing suspected offenders’ vehicles is one of the tactics of Operation Angola, which investigates large-scale illegal dumping of commercial waste.Whether a resident or a business, everyone should take responsibility for their own waste. Don’t give rubbish to someone who can’t prove they are a legitimate waste carrier - they may just dump it to avoid paying waste-disposal costs.Anyone using a company or individual to take away their waste should always obtain a waste transfer note as proof. If in any doubt, call the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or use the online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.Notes to editorsThe white 2004 Ford tipper truck was seized using powers under section 34B of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.The decision to crush the vehicle was taken as there was no value in selling the vehicle.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 27 September 2022        Related content      The fundamental building blocks for stability in Afghanistan: UK statement at UN Security CouncilUK-Republic of Korea Strategic Dialogue 2022UN Human Rights Council 51: Resolution Introduction for Sri LankaUK-Republic of Korea bilateral frameworkExplore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

The transfer started again on Thursday afternoon (11 August) due to low river levels at Chester-le-Street.The Agency also requested Northumbrian Water make additional releases from Kielder reservoir into the River Tyne to maintain oxygen levels in the estuary to support salmon migration in the country’s top salmon river. Almost 12,000 fish were counted moving upstream during July, the highest July total on record.They’ve worked with holders of 35 abstraction licences to issue ‘hands off flow’ conditions, which means licences holders have been told that river levels are low and as a result abstraction must stop to protect the environment.Rachael Caldwell, Environment Agency Area Environment Manager in the North East, said:River flows across most of the North East are low after a prolonged period of dry weather, and with the warm weather set to continue we expect levels will continue to drop.We’re looking at the impacts of dry weather across the region to make sure we can act to preserve water for wildlife and people as we experience extreme weather conditions.We are taking action alongside Government, water companies, environmental and angling groups and farmers to manage these impacts, such as operating water transfer schemes and managing abstraction licences.On 9 August the Environment Agency declared prolonged dry weather in the North East.Prolonged dry weather is a natural event which has become more likely with climate change. It occurs as a result of low rainfall for an extended period of time. Once prolonged dry weather is declared, actions are taken to minimise impacts on the environment.For water saving tips visit Waterwise.If people see any environmental impacts due to dry weather, such as fish in distress, it should be reported to the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 12 August 2022        Related content      Escaping the jaws of death: ensuring enough water in 2050Explore the topicDrought and water availabilityIs this page useful?

The project was awarded £30,000 from the Environment Agency’s Water Environment Investment Fund.The Devils Brook rises in the chalk hills above the Dorset villages of Dewlish and Cheselbourne and flows south to join the Piddle.  It is an important wild trout and sea trout spawning and nursery stream.‘Slow the flow’ techniques, including tree and hedge planting, sediment traps, buffer strips and new wetland areas, have reduced losses to the river, resulting in improved water quality.Where sections of the watercourse have been fenced off, and a buffer strip stops animals from entering, there has been a marked increase in Ranunculus growth.  This healthy vegetation holds up water levels, creating important cover for fish and aquatic invertebrates.Luke Kozak, Environment Agency project manager, said:By working with natural processes, the project has already improved riparian and in-stream habitat and water quality.  Our funding has been crucial in enabling FWAG to engage with partners and landowners, with some fantastic results and great examples of partnership working.We now hope to use our experiences gained from the Devils Brook project to improve chalk streams across Dorset.The project partners are: Dorset Wildlife Trust, Wild Trout Trust, Wessex Water, Dorset County Council, and local landowners.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 22 June 2022        Related content      Tackling promoters of mass-marketed tax avoidance schemesHMRC issue briefing: HMRC’s approach to tax fraudIssue briefing: Real Time InformationIssue briefing: taxing the profits of multinational companiesIssue briefing: volunteering and charitable donationsExplore the topicPollution and environmental qualityIs this page useful?

This follows an investigation which began in 2017.The company, who operated on the land, have paid costs of £8,137.36 and have made a donation of £30,000 to the Land Trust, a registered charity which works to improve former coalfield sites across Yorkshire.When officers from the Environment Agency inspected the farm to check compliance with environmental permits they found that excessive amounts of sludge had been imported.They also found that spreading had occurred to land on a large scale without notification to the Environment Agency. Enquiries revealed that the sewage sludge had not been treated prior to spreading.When challenged by Environment Agency officers the company eventually stopped operating and all remaining stockpiled sewage sludge was removed. A crop of contaminated peas planted in error by the landowners was destroyed.Two companies who own the fields in question were issued with VMPs for breaches of the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulation 2015.Sutcliffe Farmers Limited paid £7,521.54 and Senviro Limited paid £2,507.73, with each also paying costs of £8,137.63. A VMP is a proportionate monetary penalty for the more serious cases of non-compliance.A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said:We take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously. Where there is evidence, the Environment Agency uses a full range of enforcement options.Enforcement Undertakings allow businesses who fail to comply with legal requirements or pollute the environment to come into compliance.The Environment Agency is increasingly using this method of enforcement where there is opportunity to restore and improve the environment, change behaviour and improve practices of the offender.We rely on communities to report pollution and environmental issues to us, and urge people to report issues to us on our 24 hour incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.Euan Hall, the chief executive for The Land Trust, said:This award has made a huge difference to the sites on our South Yorkshire portfolio.We have already been able to deliver a number of projects which have been of huge benefit to the communities that live and work around our sites.We are very pleased to have been able to help the Environment Agency undo some of the damage that had been done and make improvements that will benefit the local area for the long-term.Notes to editorWhat is an enforcement undertaking (EU)?An EU is available to the Environment Agency as an alternative sanction to prosecution or monetary penalty for dealing with certain environmental offences.It is a legally-binding voluntary agreement proposed by a business (or an individual) when the EA has reasonable grounds to suspect that an environmental offence has occurred.EUs for environmental offences were introduced under the Environmental Civil Sanctions (England) Order 2010 and the Environmental Civil Sanctions (Miscellaneous Amendments) (England) Regulations 2010.Why use enforcement undertakings?businesses will voluntarily secure compliance now and in the future, without attracting a criminal recordthe environment, local community and those directly impacted by the offending can benefit through actions being offered in an EUthey allow us to deal with the less intentional and polluting offending in a more proportionate way than prosecution through the criminal courtsEUs go beyond the bare minimum needed for a business to comply, as shown in the list of accepted EUs we publish on our websiteHow can businesses benefit from enforcement undertakings instead of prosecution?Accepting an EU is always at the discretion of the EA. But if accepted replaces the need for an alternative sanction, such as prosecution or monetary penalty.The EA has produced guidance and standard forms to help those wishing to make offers.However, we expect responsible businesses to co-operate and seek our advice at an early stage, as we are more likely to accept EUs which have been offered early or proactively.When offering an EU, businesses must accept responsibility for the offending.They must also include actions which will stop offending, ensure future compliance and protect any harm/damage.They must also make a financial contribution towards a suitable environmental project.What is a variable monetary penalty (VMP)?A VMP is a proportionate monetary penalty for the more serious cases of non-compliance.How much is a VMP?The maximum amount for any VMP is £250,000 for each offence.  The exact amount is calculated using the methodology in Annex 1 of our Enforcement and Sanctions Policy.When can VMPs be used?A VMP can be used in the following situations:when there is evidence of negligence or mismanagementwhen there is an environmental impactto remove an identifiable financial gain or saving as a result of the breachwhere it is not in the public interest to prosecuteWhat happens to the money once the VMP has been paid?The money is transferred to Her Majesty’s Treasury – the Environment Agency does not keep the money to fund its own activities or have a say in how the money is used.  The Environment Agency is however, able to recover its costs, using an Enforcement Cost Recovery Notice.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 27 October 2021Explore the topicEnvironmental permitsIs this page useful?

It will involve lifting an additional 100 2-tonne rock filled bags by a large crane situated on the A6 into the River Derwent to reduce erosion and limit damage to an Environment Agency flood wall that sits next to the privately owned wall that has collapsed.The Environment Agency is working with Derbyshire County Council and Derbyshire Dales District Council to manage the risk of flooding from the River Derwent following the collapse of a privately owned wall behind businesses in Crown Square, Matlock in February this year.To carry out the work, the A6 will be closed from Matlock Bridge to just before the bus and train station entrance during the times of the main works.  Also, traffic from the north and south will be diverted over Matlock Bridge, with traffic lights on Crown Square. While delays are expected, the change will save northbound traffic from a long diversion.A footpath alongside the River Derwent will also be closed with pedestrians and cyclists being diverted along the A6 pavement.Before then, a survey team will also be taking measurements to gather valuable ground level data to inform a longer-term engineering solution. Weather conditions permitting, the survey team will be wading in the River Derwent and will be also flying a drone along the river corridor on Monday 4 April.A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said:We apologise in advance for any temporary inconvenience caused by these works and thank local businesses, residents and the community for their patience while we undertake these essential flood risk management works.The rock-filled bags are only a temporary measure and work is currently underway to design a longer-term engineering solution. This will involve drilling 2 boreholes while the temporary works are being carried out, one on either side of the river, to gather important geological information.While there may be some localised impacts from the borehole drilling and wider construction activity, our contractors will do their best to mitigate any impacts. We also wish to reassure the community that our surveyors will take care to only film the riverside area.Further informationThe first stage of work to protect the Environment Agency’s flood wall, which sits next to the damaged wall, involved the removal of trees nearest to Matlock Bridge on Thursday 24 March to create a safe working area for contractors to carry out the essential flood prevention work.Following the collapse of the privately owned wall in February this year, the Environment Agency instructed Jackson Civil Engineering to complete an immediate repair by placing over 50 rock-filled bags in the River Derwent using a large crane situated on the A6. These emergency works were completed within 24 hours of the wall collapsing due to a forecast of further high-water levels on the River Derwent.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 30 March 2022        Related content      Six-monthly report on Hong Kong: July to December 2021Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Players can also do a physical challenge, like 10 star jumps.Environment Agency project lead Kelly Haynes said:We are thrilled to be part of this exciting engagement programme for young people, which inspires through the power of sport at home and abroad.This fun game teaches young people about the waste hierarchy and the small steps they can take each day to change behaviours, influence others, and help nip plastic pollution in the bud.A spokesperson for Rosetta Primary School in London, said:The Preventing Plastic Pollution game, offered as part of the Bound for Beijing Challenge, is a quick and easy physical activity to get your class moving while highlighting the importance of waste. The pupils loved the reboot of snakes and ladders in the new active board game.The game has been created by the Environment Agency’s plastics and sustainability team on behalf of the Interreg-funded Preventing Plastic Pollution project.It builds on new national sustainability guidance for the sports sector, which also encourages readers to sign up to the Big Plastic Pledge - a global campaign founded by Olympic gold medallist Hannah Mills that calls on sport representatives to ramp up efforts to tackle plastic waste.The initiative also supports the Environment Agency’s ambition to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste, helping to achieve the goals and commitments outlined in its EA2025 5-year plan to create better place for people, wildlife and the environment, and the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan.Notes for editorsInterreg Preventing Plastic Pollution (PPP): PPP seeks to understand and reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in the river and marine environments. By looking at the catchment from source to sea, the project identifies and targets hotspots for plastic, embeds behaviour change in local communities and businesses, and implements effective solutions and alternatives.PPP is a €14 million funded EU INTERREG VA France (Channel) England Programme project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund which works mainly across Brest Harbour, Bay of Douarnenez, Bay of Veys, Poole Harbour, Medway, Test and Itchen, East Hampshire, Tamar, and Great Ouse catchments.Partners are the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Queen Mary University of London, LABOCEA Conseil, Expertise et Analyses, Syndicat mixte établissement public de gestion et d’aménagement de la baie de Douarnenez, Office Français De La Biodiversité, Parc naturel marin d’Iroise, Brest Métropole, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Counseil départemental de la Manche, Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, The Rivers Trust, Syndicat de bassin de l’Elorn, ACTIMAR, Brest’aim, Westcountry Rivers Trust, South East Rivers Trust, and Plymouth City Council.Environment Agency: As a regulator, the Environment Agency prevents waste plastic entering the environment by cracking down on waste crime and poor waste management.

Without them, this achievement would not have been possible.“Our combined efforts to create new woodlands have boosted biodiversity, helped safeguard our environment for future generations and supported sustainable rural communities.“We are always on the lookout for volunteers to spend the day tree planting with us and with three thousand trees ready to be planted between now and March 2022 I would like to urge anyone interested to get in touch.”Potential volunteers should contact mike.farrell@environment-agency.gov.uk to find out more.The Environment Agency is not stopping at 80,000 trees. As part of the £76million Kendal Flood Risk Management Scheme, the Environment Agency has committed to planting 4,000 trees in Kendal with a further 15,000 being planted throughout the River Kent Catchment over the coming years. Different sized trees will be planted in order to serve different functions to best suit locations. Native species will be planted in more rural locations and in the town centre locations ornamental trees that are suitable for urban planting will be planted to suit the character of the town. The Environment Agency has also been working with community groups in Kendal to take cuttings from the existing trees along the river. These cuttings will be replanted around the town once construction of the £76million flood risk management scheme is complete.As part of Skirting and Whangs Beck Flood Risk Management Scheme and Carlisle Flood Risk Management Scheme, the Environment Agency will be working with partners to plant even more trees and improve the local environment for future generations.The Cumbria Natural Flood Management programme has contributed by planting over 30,000 trees in the last four years, with even more still to be planted. These trees help increase water infiltration into the ground, create areas of wet canopy evaporation and absorb carbon, they are a key tool in helping reduce flood risk and keeping our climate cool.The tree planting has been completed with the help of pupils, from a number of schools across the North of England, local angling clubs, University students in Cumbria, associations and environmentalists adding up to thousands of volunteer hours.A spokesperson for the Oak Field Special Needs school said:“Oak Field School is a school for children with severe learning difficulties aged 3 to 19 years. For over 10 years, sixth form students and old students have had the great opportunity to work with the Environment Agency team.The students have planted trees and cleared Himalayan Balsam, it has been an amazing and successful project to be involved in over the years, giving the young people the confidence and the experience of working together to put something back into the environment.The students learnt a lot about the need to care for the countryside and the impact that conservation has on the local environment. Many of the students return every year and look forward to meeting the friendly and helpful Environment Agency team.As well as the planting of over 80 thousand trees, school children have helped to plant over 5000 wildflowers and bulbs including bluebells, primrose, and great burnet, across 7 sites in Cumbria, including the River Greta, River Cocker and the River Glendermackin. This supported the children’s John Muir award, an environmental award scheme focused on wild places completed with Derwent Hill outdoor education centre. The scheme supports people to connect with, enjoy and care for nature, landscape, and the natural environment.Matthew Ellis Centre Director & Outdoor Education Advisor at Derwent Hill said:“Derwent Hill opened in 1962 and is owned by Sunderland City Council. The Centre is one of the Premier Outdoor Education Centres in the UK and holds the AHOEC Gold Standard Learning Outside the Classroom Quality Badge. Our primary aim is to provide high quality outdoor education residentials for young people.“For several years we have worked in Partnership with the Environment Agency on our John Muir Award Programmes. These courses have a specific environmental focus and encourage youngsters to Discover, Explore, Conserve the natural world and share their experiences.“The Environment Agency has been instrumental in supporting these children to plant over three thousand trees, help to limit erosion of riverbanks and worked to protect fragile habitats and eco systems. Their support has been invaluable in helping participants to realise the threats and challenges facing our flora and fauna and to educate them on what can be done to help.“We very much hope that this Partnership continues to do such vital work and we continue to be very grateful for their support.”Pete Leeson Partnership Manager for the Woodlands Trust in Cumbria said:“Working with communities, partners and landowners to create woodland and hedgerows for people and wildlife is mutually beneficial to the environment.“In the last decade we have worked extensively with the Environment Agency particularly focusing on riparian habitat which supports natural flood management and fisheries improvements. We have supplied tens of thousands of trees for this purpose and look forward to planting many more in the years to come!”Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 9 December 2021Explore the topicClimate change and energyWildlife, animals, biodiversity and ecosystemsIs this page useful?

It will seek to meet the goal by reducing the emissions of its own activities and supply chain by 45%, with the remaining emissions addressed through tree planting or other measures. The Environment Agency will also explore whether it could become an absolute zero organisation – eliminating all carbon emissions from its own activities and its supply chain - by 2050.This will put the organisation at the forefront of tackling the climate emergency through eliminating its own emissions while continuing to protect communities and create more climate resilient places.Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, said:“Tackling the climate emergency is the biggest challenge facing humankind, and every day our organisation has to deal with its effects. Alongside working with communities to plan and adapt for the unavoidable impacts of climate change, we must also take action as an organisation to reduce our own contribution to this existential threat.“We are under no illusion about the scale of the challenge that we have set ourselves, but action is needed if we are to preserve our planet for future generations.”Gareth Redmond-King, Head of Climate Change at WWF-UK, said:“In the face of a climate and nature crisis, it is encouraging to see a public sector organisation leading by example. The science is clear – we are at a critical crossroads and the time for bold and immediate action to fight climate change is now.“Next year, the UK will host a global climate summit giving us a major opportunity to show international leadership in tackling this planetary emergency. But we must demonstrate we’re walking the talk at home by taking rapid and ambitious action to reduce our emissions in a way that also helps people and communities.”The Environment Agency already has a successful track record in reducing its own carbon footprint, giving confidence that this ambitious goal can be achieved. By last year it had achieved a 48% reduction in operational carbon emissions compared with 2006/7 – going further and faster than its March 2020 target of a 45% reduction.These carbon reductions have been delivered at the same time as the agency has worked to protect 300,000 homes from the effects of flooding and continued to protect communities, and made huge progress to improve water quality - bringing rivers which were biologically dead back to life and giving our coasts the cleanest bathing waters since records began.The Environment Agency will also be working to ensure that adapting to the future challenges of climate change is a part of every major decision the organisation makes. The flood and coastal strategy will help the country plan and adapt to threats of climate change up to 2100 and create climate resilient places, but now every major decision will be made on the basis of how these core responsibilities can be delivered and how it can help tackle the climate emergency.Chris Stark, Chief Executive of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s independent advisor on climate change, said:“Achieving net zero in the UK by 2050 will require ambition from government, industry and individuals alike. Bold steps are needed and the Environment Agency is demonstrating real leadership by making this important commitment.”Nick Molho, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, an alliance of major businesses, academic institutions and NGOs committed to decarbonising the UK economy, said:“Dealing with climate change creates a twin challenge. On the one hand, we have to invest significantly to make our homes and critical infrastructure more resilient to increasingly frequent extreme weather events such as intense floods and droughts. But there’s only so much climate change we can adapt to and we need public sector bodies and businesses to urgently and drastically reduce their emissions to limit climate change impacts.“Today’s announcement by the Environment Agency is a great example of commitments that need to be taken on economy-wide and shows how quickly large organisations can deliver meaningful emission cuts with the right leadership, strategy and support in place.”   While the work to protect people and the environment will not change, delivering the scale of reduction emissions necessary will require changes in how the Environment Agency delivers its vital work.In order to approach the challenge of net zero, each and every part of the Environment Agency will produce a carbon reduction plan. However, recognising that these issues cannot be tackled alone, the organisation will also be working with suppliers and other stakeholders to explore how they can reduce their carbon footprint, and harness the technological innovation of the future to reach these ambitious goals.Through this collaborative approach to carbon reduction, the Environment Agency will not only aim to become a net zero organisation by 2030, but suppliers, stakeholders, and businesses and organisations in other sectors will also be encouraged to take similar journeys to tackle the climate emergency.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 10 October 2019Explore the topicClimate change and energyIs this page useful?

It can help society better understand the largest public health threat of the century: climate change.Video: EA2025 - Business as usual won’t tackle the challenges we faceBy 2025 the Environment Agency aims to have created more climate resilient places and infrastructure, by ensuring the nation is prepared for flooding, coastal change and drought.The plan also highlights a renewed focus on improving the health of air, land and water for people and nature – and ensuring green growth for a sustainable future.Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said:Tackling climate change must become a default position for everyone. We know that life post-lockdown presents a unique opportunity to change the way we live and work for the better.We have been gifted a glimpse of how we could adapt our lives and think differently about how we operate. This applies not just to us but the communities we serve, too. People are ready to think differently, and with our new 5 year plan we want to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime chance to lead the way.Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said:The Prime Minister has announced that the country needs to build back better, build back greener, build back faster. This action plan sets out how we will help to accelerate a just transition to a low-carbon and more resilient future.Although the plan points at 2025 it starts now, and the lessons we learn along the way will help develop the whole UK workforce for the risks and opportunities of the coming decades.Since lockdown began, the Environment Agency has remained fully operational, with the majority of staff working from home, and frontline staff remaining active on the ground tackling issues such as flood risk and pollution.Staff have been making the best use of technology to continue work – such as remotely concluding legal hearings and using drones to monitor regulated sites, and looking at how we can adopt these practices in the future to be more efficient and effective. Teams have been maintaining equipment that supports public water supply, food production and river flows.The hot weather led to several fish rescues, while fisheries enforcement teams continued to investigate illegal fishing. Last month a major coastal flood defence scheme was completed which will protect more than 300 properties in West Sussex.EA2025 sets out 3 long-term goals: a nation resilient to climate change; healthy air, land and water; and green growth and a sustainable future. Some of its ambitious targets for 2020/21 include:improving more than 4,000 kilometres of rivercreating nearly 1,200 hectares of habitatand being on track to be carbon-neutral by 2030Download EA2025 in full here.Read the latest blog from Environment Agency chair Emma Howard Boyd on the launch of EA2025Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 9 July 2020    Last updated 9 July 2020      + show all updates9 July 2020Link to published plan, YouTube video and blog added9 July 2020First published.

Everyone can play a part in avoiding unnecessary plastic.We hope this interactive learning programme will be a great motivational tool for students of all ages, inspiring them to make small environmental changes in their daily lives by following the avoid, reduce, reuse and recycle lifecycle mantra – doing their bit to help marine life thrive.Schools can directly access the primary and secondary resources online, or sign up to the live question answer session via Eventbrite.Notes for editorsFull url links:Primary:https://indd.adobe.com/view/3b2b2c46-7582-45af-b082-bc751c5de00d Secondary: https://indd.adobe.com/view/3b2b2c46-7582-45af-b082-bc751c5de00dWorld Ocean Day: WOD is an annual United Nations event to remind everyone of the major role oceans play in our everyday lives. It was initiated in 1992 and over 140 countries take part today. This year the calendar event is themed ‘The Ocean: Life and Livelihoods’ and falls in the same week as the G7 Summit in Cornwall.Environment Agency role: Preventing waste plastic entering the environment by cracking down on waste crime and poor waste management is a key activity for the Environment Agency as a regulator. As an influencer, it also has an ambition to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste, helping to achieve the goals and commitments outlined in its 5 year plan to create better places for people, places and the environment, and the government’s 25 year environment plan.Preventing Plastic Pollution: Working in partnership with 18 organisations from across France and England, Preventing Plastic Pollution (PPP) seeks to understand and reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in the river and marine environments. By looking at the catchment from source to sea, the project will identify and target hotspots for plastic, embed behaviour change in local communities and businesses, and implement effective solutions and alternatives.PPP is a €14million funded EU INTERREG VA France (Channel) England Programme project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund which works mainly across seven pilot sites: Brest Harbour, Bay of Douarnenez, Bay of Veys, Poole Harbour, and the Medway, Tamar, and Great Ouse estuaries.Partners are the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Queen Mary University of London, LABOCEA Conseil, Expertise et Analyses, Syndicat mixte établissement public de gestion et d’aménagement de la baie de Douarnenez, Office Français De La Biodiversité, Parc naturel marin d’Iroise, Brest Métropole, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Counseil départemental de la Manche, Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, The Rivers Trust, Syndicat de bassin de l’Elorn, ACTIMAR, Brest’aim, Westcountry Rivers Trust, South East Rivers Trust and Plymouth City Council.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 10 May 2021Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

It is believed the vehicles were being used to dump and spread large volumes of contaminated soil at a non-permitted site.Area Environment Manager for Warwickshire with the Environment Agency, David Hudson, said:This sends out a strong message that we will use all our powers possible to stop waste crime which harms the environment, wildlife and the community, as well as undermining the work of companies that operate legitimately. We are now continuing our investigations into alleged activities at the farm.Landowners should take extra care when agreeing to the spreading of materials on their land. There are tight controls on what is allowed and illegal dumping of contaminated materials on farmland can create a significant liability for removal as well as seriously degrading the quality of the soil. In some cases the cost of removing waste can be higher than the original land value.The owners of the vehicles now have until 6 September 2019 to claim to have the vehicles returned to them by the Environment Agency. If no legitimate claim is made, the vehicles will be sold or crushed.Members of the public can report illegal waste activity anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via the online form.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 16 August 2019        Related content      Letter to The Times from Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of Environment Agency (3 August 2019)The importance of soil in a changing climateFarming rules for water from April 2018Letter to The Times from Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of Environment Agency (17 August 2019)Charity Commission alerts, decisions, reports and statementsExplore the topicEnvironmental permitsIs this page useful?

It is believed that the first reported sighting of an abandoned trailer was on Sunday 12 July.The trailers and their loads of waste containing household, commercial or industrial rubbish have all been abandoned in laybys next to major roads in the area.A spokesperson for the Environment Agency, said:We are appealing to members of the public who may have any information, however small, about the abandoned trailers full of waste to contact us as soon as possible to help with our investigation. They can call the 24-hour Environment Agency hotline or anonymously to Crimestoppers.The trailers are all in laybys on major roads and so we are hopeful that there may be witnesses to this criminal activity.We urge homeowners and businesses to check someone is registered to take their waste away as they could be breaking the law if their waste isn’t managed properly.To report illegal waste activity, or if you suspect a company is operating illegally, call the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60 or report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.Notes to editorsCheck a waste carrier, broker or dealer is registered  before you use them.Waste site operators should make sure their site is legal and check they have the right permit for their activities.It is illegal to burn most types of waste.

Teams will install at least 40m of piling in the bank. How long this takes will depend on weather and ground conditions, but once it’s complete, flood water will be pumped off the farmland, and soil and clay will be used to rebuild the bank around the piling.Meanwhile, repairs are also underway at Timberland Delph, where Environment Agency teams moved 100 1-tonne sandbags and equipment into place over the weekend to help protect the bank from further damage. Pumps are shifting floodwater from the farmland and soon long-reach diggers will set to work plugging the breach with an estimated 1,000 tonnes of clay. Once the clay is in place, piles will be installed to strengthen the bank.Temporary repairs also remain in place on the Billinghay Skirth, where a number of homes have been protected while engineers plan a permanent fix.Elsewhere around the county, inspections are being carried out and smaller repairs are underway to fix some locks, pointing doors, and banks that overtopped, eroded, or experienced seepage when they were under pressure from the high volume of water for a prolonged period of time.Lincolnshire had more than twice its usual amount of rainfall this autumn, with 110mm falling in November alone. This was on top of twice September’s average rainfall and two and a half times the usual rainfall for October.Despite the intense weather – which set record levels on the Rivers Witham and Ancholme, caused surface water flooding and saturated the ground – flood defences across the county held up well, defending thousands of homes.The Brant, Till, Market Rasen, Freshney, Louth and Horncastle flood reservoirs protected around 8,000 properties, while 1,000 miles of raised embankment successfully held the waters back from around 180,000 properties at risk of flooding.Environment Agency Area Director Norm Robinson said:Despite the extreme rainfall that pushed our rivers to their limits – and the fact that a third of Lincolnshire is below sea level – the vast majority of homes, businesses and land has remained safe from flooding. In fact, less than 1% of the county’s agricultural land has been affected.But we know how devastating flooding can be for those affected, which is why we’re completing repairs as quickly as possible. This work will have to be done in stages, but throughout the process, we’ll continue working closely with the IDBs and the NFU, and we are in near daily contact with the landowners affected, giving advice, guidance and updates on our progress.Over the coming days and weeks, Environment Agency teams will continue to carry out inspections, monitor defences, and carry out any further repairs as needed.Although minimal rain is forecast for the next week, meaning river levels will drop back to more normal levels and the ground will begin to dry out, local people are still being reminded to check their flood risk and sign up for alerts and warnings at www.gov.uk/flood or by calling 0345 988 1188.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 4 December 2019Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Both companies were fined £11,500 and each ordered to pay £4,063 in costs and a £170 victim surcharge after the Environment Agency brought the case to court.Following a complaint from the public, Environment Agency officers investigated the incident at Withgill Farm, Great Mitton near Clitheroe, which is bounded by the river Hodder to the west and the river Ribble to the east.Environment Agency officers found that a significant volume of slurry from a dairy herd had entered a field drain outlet at the farm and flowed into a small stream, leading into the river Hodder – a river well known for its salmon fishery. The Hodder was discoloured and smelled of slurry for several kilometres and this continued beyond its confluence with the river Ribble. The Ribble at Lambing Clough near Dinckley, over 7.5 km from the entry point, was deemed unfishable by anglers.The next day, Environment Agency officers saw that an earth dam had been built across the end of the stream to prevent further pollution and witnessed contactors tankering slurry away. Below the dam, the stream had almost dried up and slurry was no longer entering the river, however, the river was discoloured heavily downstream of the confluence with a distinct cloudy plume extending into the main channel.The court heard that the River Hodder’s ecology was largely unaffected by the incident, however, there was significant impact on amenity, on the River Hodder and the River Ribble.Jackie Monks, the Environment Agency’s Environment Officer, said: “Pollution incidents such as this can cause distress to local communities, reduce water quality and spoil ecosystems.“As this prosecution shows, we take tough action against any company or individual who causes significant pollution and damage to the environment and we hope that these fines act as a deterrent and help us better protect the environment and the public in the future.“This incident could have caused major harm to the fishery in the River Hodder and River Ribble, however, we believe that because it happened during very cold and wet weather, it prevented a major fish kill.“Environment Agency staff respond to pollution incidents 24/7 to contain pollution and protect water quality. We investigate pollution incidents to find the source, stop the problem and understand how best to reduce any impacts on local communities and the environment. We would urge anyone who notices pollution to land or water to call our hotline: 0800 80 70 60.”The companies refused to cooperate with the Environment Agency’s investigation, however, did implement works to try to remedy the problem as the contractors constructed a dam and tankered the slurry away.The court heard that Wilthgill Farm had received a previous conviction, two cautions and a number of warning letters - all for water pollution offences. Wilson Contractors Limited had no previous convictions.The River Hodder is a county biological heritage site which rises in the Bowland Fells. It then flows approximately 23 miles to its confluence with the River Ribble, of which it is a major tributary. The catchment falls within the Forest of Bowland, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The River Hodder is a highly valued salmonid fishery and, together with the Ribble, is very popular with anglers.Environmental incidents can be reported to the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 807060, waste crime can also be reported anonymously via Crimestoppers online or on 0800 555111.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 9 October 2019Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityIs this page useful?

This year’s work started in July and, in order to minimise the impact on the environment on and around the Washes, had to be completed by 31 October.The construction works were originally estimated to take place over four summers (2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020), with a further year allowed to establish the new grass cover (2021).The detailed design work continued through the winter period 2018-19. The evolving design and material inconsistency on site has resulted in a change to the intended bank profile, increasing the footprint of the Middle Level Barrier Bank and the need to import more material.This additional work, along with periods of wet weather, has resulted in the construction programme being extended.Claire Jouvray, Environment Agency Operations Manager for the Great Ouse catchment, said it was a vital scheme for people living in communities nearby.She said:We’ve had a really challenging year this year with road works impacting deliveries and the wet weather in September and October stopping work on the bank.Thanks to partners, our contractors, neighbours and local authorities we have been able to keep disruption to a minimum.We’d like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding during this complex programme of work which will take longer than predicted at the outset.We will be holding public drop in events in the new year to showcase the work we have done so far, to outline the revised timescale for this vital scheme and discuss our plans for the Welney Wash road temporary barrier.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 1 November 2019        Related content      Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss speaking at the FT's Women at the Top eventDefence Secretary Ben Wallace addresses the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 2019Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss speech at The Telegraph's Women Mean Business eventDefence Transition Referral Protocol (DTRP)Military court centres court listingsExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Our staff are now working with local authorities to support community recovery. More than 22,000 properties have been protected from flooding thanks to Environment Agency flood schemes and warnings.Environment Agency engineers are also  inspecting flood defences for sign of any damage during the flooding and repairing any damage. Specialist teams are flying aeroplanes with ‘LIDAR’ (light detection and ranging) technology to scan and map the affected areas. These surveys allow staff to identify the impact on defences before carrying out manual inspections.While the flood risk is reducing across most of the country, with so much water remaining in river catchments, rivers are expected to respond quickly to any future rainfall. There may be ongoing minor river flooding impacts into tomorrow.Clare Dinnis, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency said:“Despite an improving picture, recent heavy rainfall means that minor river flooding is expected to continue today (Tuesday) in South Yorkshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. Minor impacts are also possible in parts of Hull and East Yorkshire today and tomorrow.“Our field teams are working around the clock to inspect and – where necessary – repair defences.  Since early November our flood defences have helped to protect over 22,000 properties from flooding.“We are working closely with local authorities and partners to help communities get back on their feet.  “Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the recent flooding.“People should check their flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date with the latest situation at https://www.gov.uk/check-flood-risk, call Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or follow @EnvAgency on Twitter for the latest flood updates.”‎Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 18 November 2019    Last updated 19 November 2019      + show all updates19 November 2019Updating information on flood response18 November 2019First published.

These measures are generally divided into three main categories: river and floodplain management; woodland management; and run-off management. Some examples include: tree and hedgerow planting; buffer strips (which trap sediment and slowing water flow); leaky barriers (which enhance floodplain storage); woodland creation; and sediment traps.Fiona Sugden, Environment Agency Project Manager, said:There is a long history of flooding in the Lower Aire catchment which has a huge effect on local residents, the environment and wildlife. The Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme’s Natural Flood Management Programme plays an important role in reducing flood risk and bringing wider environmental and social benefits to the area.The project has seen huge successes so far and we are keen for more landowners to get in touch to find out more about the benefits of introducing natural flood management measures on their land.This scale of natural flood management will provide several wider environmental and social benefits to the area, such as: increasing biodiversity, tree canopy cover and creating habitat for wildlife, capturing and storing carbon, improved land management, better water quality and helping to regenerate rural and urban areas.Ian Coldwell, Project Manager for the White Rose Forest said:This natural flood management project is important for nature, our environment and everyone living in the River Aire catchment. We are working with our network of local White Rose Forest partners to invite interested landowners across the Aire valley to find out more about the support available for natural flood management projects on their land.A complete package of design, funding, and delivery is available to make each project as simple and straight forward as possible for landowners. Although the scheme runs throughout the year, we would encourage landowners to register their interest early via the White Rose Forest website to ensure timely delivery, particularly for popular projects such as tree planting.Councillor Helen Hayden, Leeds City Council’s executive member for infrastructure and climate, said:Natural flood management techniques can play a key role in improving our area’s resilience to climate change. In conjunction with the engineering work being carried out also through the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme it could significantly reduce the flood risk to previously affected residents and businesses in Leeds.The council has an ambitious target of planting up to two million trees, which will contribute significantly to our area’s resilience and we know natural flood management also has environmental benefits, which is why it is so important.As well as reducing flood risk, landowners or land managers could benefit from;improved soil fertility and reductions in soil loss, pesticide and fertiliser runoffreduced effects of dry weatherimproved drainage of waterlogged areasbankside fencing can reduce the risk of waterborne disease and lameness in stockhedges and tree planting can provide shelter and shade for stockreduced erosion of tracks and river banksless need for gravel managementpotential income generation from commercial woodlands and short rotation willow coppiceThis initiative follows on from natural flood management projects recently undertaken by the Environment Agency as part of the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme’s Natural Flood Management Project on behalf of Leeds City Council. Funded by Leeds City Council, this is one of the UK’s largest natural flood management schemes which aims to use natural processes to slow the flow and build a more resilient river catchment that can respond better to extreme weather.Broughton Hall Estate near Skipton is one of the sites where natural flood management techniques are currently being used with support from the White Rose Forest and funding from Defra’s ‘Nature for Climate’ fund. Work so far this year has included restructuring several areas of woodland, installing leaky barriers and land restoration, as well as the creation of up to 110,000 cubic meters of storage space for surface water.If you have land and would like to know more visit the White Rose Forest website on www.whiteroseforest.org/aireriver or email whiteroseforest@kirklees.gov.uk.For more information about the LeedsFAS visit www.leeds.gov.uk/fas.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 5 August 2021Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

The installation of these products will run until December with funding provided from the Environment Agency.The new flood protection products installed on Stanley's home.Environment Agency Area Flood Risk Manager Paul Stockhill said:With our changing climate we are unable to eliminate the risk of flooding, but we can help communities be more resilient to it. We often build large scale defences to try and manage flood water, but sometimes property level measures might be appropriate. We hope that these measures will help to give these residents in York reassurance, helping ensure a flood does less damage and life can get back to normal much quicker.This investment is part of the £45 million Environment Agency programme to improve flood defences in York.  Together with a further £38 million invested to improve the Foss Barrier, our work will better protect over 2,000 properties across the city.Stanley Shoobridge, a resident in Acaster Malbis, York who is benefiting from the scheme, said:I’m very pleased with my new defences, and how easy they are to fit. In the past I’ve had to drag sandbags into position to try and protect my home. I don’t flood frequently, but when I do, I’m on an island and only people with waders can reach me. I’m 92 years of age and it’s now so much easier to put my new barrier into place.I live in an 18th century cottage and underground seepage is also a problem.  I’ve now been given pumps to take care of that, and four automatic air grates have been fitted, so I no longer have to worry about covering them up.Cllr Paula Widdowson, Executive Member for Climate Change and the Environment, from City of York Council, said:Protecting peoples’ homes and businesses is an absolute priority, particularly as flood events become ever more frequent. This significant extra investment will help us better protect residents in and around the villages of Naburn and Acaster Malbis and build on the work already being carried out across the city.More than 2,000 properties are now better protected in York from future flooding with thanks to the £110 million flood alleviation programme, which is being delivered by City of York Council and the Environment Agency. Through this programme, we’re implementing vital flood alleviation schemes across the city to further reduce the impact of flooding and climate change on our communities.You can check your flood risk, sign up for free flood warnings and keep up to date with the latest situation at Check for flooding, call  Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or follow @EnvAgency on Twitter for the latest flood updates.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 21 March 2023Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

The close season for sea trout also begins on 1 November and runs until 2 April. In Yorkshire, the close season for salmon runs 1st November to 5th April. The close season for sea trout begins on 1st November and runs until 2nd April.Anglers must check local information and byelaws to ensure they are up to date on local restrictions. More information and specific advice can be found here.Licence holders who fish for salmon and sea trout are also encouraged to submit their annual catch return. This can be completed online or by sending in a paper catch return, the information is vital to help inform national salmon and sea trout stock assessments.Wild Atlantic salmon and sea trout are experiencing decline, with stocks now categorised as being ‘at risk’ or ‘probably at risk’. Reducing disturbances on fish when they are spawning and at their most vulnerable helps to protect stocks for the future.The Environment Agency recognises that fishing is not the sole cause of stock decline but by observing the close season anglers are playing their part in boosting the long-term resilience of iconic fish species.David Shears, Environment Agency Senior Fisheries Enforcement Officer, said:Taking steps to limit the pressures on vital fish stocks will help support healthy, thriving populations in our rivers long into the future. The annual close season is an important time of year. It improves the resilience and sustainability of our native species, which is important for the wider ecosystem.Anglers who wish to fish during the winter months are permitted to catch coarse fish, such as grayling, barbel and chub, for which a valid fishing licence is required.During the close season, enforcement officers from the Environment Agency patrol riverbanks to prevent illegal fishing and protect fisheries. The maximum fine for byelaw offences is £50,000 upon conviction.Those who suspect illegal fishing should report it to the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 28 October 2022    Last updated 28 October 2022      + show all updates28 October 2022First published.Explore the topicFishing regulations, monitoring and enforcementIs this page useful?

These charges included failing to allow an inspection by Environment Agency officers and causing them alarm and distress through threatening behaviour and abusive words.He was fined a total of £320 for the offences and ordered to pay legal costs and a victim surcharge amounting to a total of £931.The Prosecuting solicitor for the Environment Agency told the court that on Tuesday 27 April 2021, two Environment Agency officers attended Beckfield Stables in response to information received regarding burning waste at the site.Mr Cliff confronted the attending Environment Agency officers, using foul language and threatening behaviour, which forced both officers to leave.Andrew Turner, Team Manager for the Environment Agency in the North East, said:Our officers do an important job when investigating reports of waste crime, helping to protect the environment by ensuring people and companies operate within the law. We have a zero tolerance policy on abuse and will take appropriate action on any offences committed against our officers.In mitigation, Mr Cliff explained that he felt unfairly targeted by the authorities and combined with a decline in health and personal issues, resulted in his short temper and angry nature that day, for which he later apologised.The court did consider a community penalty for Mr Cliff, however due to his ill health, decided to penalise him with a fine. The Magistrate chairing the hearing commented that the incident “was an expensive loss of temper.”Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 25 February 2022        Related content      Rod fishing byelaws: North EastRiver Thames: lock and weir fishing mapsRod fishing byelaws: South WestLocal fishing byelaws (rules)Rod fishing byelaws: MidlandsExplore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

The prosecution at Bolton Crown Court saw company Director Sean Chadwick of Manchester Rd, Leigh, and Company Secretary Michael Chadwick of Kenwood Ave, Leigh were sentenced to were each given a 10 month sentence suspended for 18 months as well as two 14 week sentences each suspended for 18 months. Gary Chadwick, of Culcheth Hall Drive, Warrington, also a Director of SC Chadwick and Sons, was given two 14 week sentences suspended for 18 months.Both Shaun and Michael Chadwick pleaded guilty to three charges – one charge for the permit breaches over time at the Bolton site and an identical one for the Leigh site and failure to comply with a Reg 36 enforcement notice at the Leigh site. Gary Chadwick pleaded guilty to the charges related to the Leigh site.The Environment Agency brought the case after an extensive investigation. Throughout the investigation the sites remained non-compliant with its permit, much of the time significantly so which resulted in the sites being at high risk of pollution.The Bolton site was investigated over a period from 28 June 2014 to 27 February 2016 (Chadwick’s ceased trading in 2016) as it was not operated to minimise risk of pollution. The site also exceeded maximum waste height limits, Officer’s reported, following an investigation, that waste had increased in height to 5m. The sheer volume of waste on site was preventing it being processed efficiently and preventing vehicles moving around safely.Other pollution risks were fire and odour there were a total of 172 odour reports from 2014 to when the site closed. Eight fires were reported between 2006-2013 and on inspection with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service it was clear fire risks were not managed in accordance with their Fire prevention plans.The fundamental problem with both sites, which resulted in the prosecution, was they consistently brought more waste on than was removed, apparently for financial reasons.Environment Agency Officers made numerous visits to the sites offering advice and guidance. The Bolton site is now cleared after SC Chadwicks and Sons Ltd abandoned it leaving Bolton Council to clear at an estimated cost of £3million.Mark Easedale, an Area Environment Manager for the Environment Agency, said:“The Environment Agency is committed to taking robust enforcement action against those who break the law, to protect communities and the environment.“In this case the defendants consistently failed to respond to advice and guidance, warnings and statutory notices requiring action to improve operations at both of their sites.“The Environment Agency permit waste sites to ensure they operate legally and with minimal impact on the environment. Sites that operate outside the terms of their permit undercut legitimate businesses and, in this case, caused harm to the environment through waste fires and misery for residents and businesses. They also cost taxpayers money as Bolton Council had to clear the site at considerable expense. We are determined to make life hard for criminals and support legitimate business by disrupting and stopping the criminal element.”Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 17 December 2021Explore the topicWaste and recyclingIs this page useful?

Mr Connell was also disqualified from being a director of a company for 3 yearsThe Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted Mr Connell an Oldham based man, for the illegal storage and treatment of approximately 6,000 cubic metres of waste, equivalent of roughly 12,000 standard 6x4 trailers, on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Manchester.The case was brought against Mr Connell, director of CK Waste Limited, when he allowed an environmental offence to occur. The site failed to operate within their permit and managed waste without a set of procedures that identified and minimised risk of pollution and was therefore handling waste illegally.Mr Connell was also issued with an enforcement notice as excessive piled waste posed a serious fire risk after being stored for too long. Following the issue of the enforcement notice, Mr Connell failed to take steps to reduce the piled waste on site and failed to provide a fire prevention plan.Mr Connell was sentenced to 22 weeks, imprisonment suspended for 12 months, ordered to pay costs of £8,132.45 and a victim surcharge of £115. Mr Connell was also disqualified from being a director of a company for 3 yearsAn Environment Agency spokesperson said:“The Environment Agency welcome the result of this prosecution for the offences committed by Mr Connell, director of CK Waste Limited. Mr Connell was offered extensive advice and guidance from Environment Agency officers but despite this, failed to take steps to reduce piled waste at the site in Dukinfield, Manchester.“We all create waste, and we all have a responsibility to ensure our waste is handled correctly. This prosecution sends out a strong signal to others that we will continue to fight tirelessly to combat illegal waste crime and bring those responsible to justice.

Other stations included sections on rod licence evasion and how it affects Fisheries, and an input from Angling Trust coaches was provided with brief 1:1 coaching for any Officers that wanted to experience angling and its positive wellbeing benefits.Rod fishing licence income is vital to the work of the Environment Agency to maintain, improve and develop fisheries. Revenue generated from rod fishing licence sales is reinvested to benefit angling with work including tackling illegal fishing. Fishing without a licence is not only illegal, but also takes away income that would otherwise be invested into the local fisheries and angling communities.Damien Linney, Fisheries Enforcement Officer at the Environment Agency, said:“Responsible fishing provides a great opportunity to connect with nature and feel the range of benefits doing so can bring. However it is important to remember you must have a valid rod licence and adhere to fishing bylaws and fishery rules.“Fishing with illegal methods poses a risk to fish stocks, including already vulnerable stocks of salmon and eel, and other wildlife. It also undermines all the investment the Environment Agency makes using rod licence income and work by our partners in improving fisheries.”Dave Lees, Angling Trust Northwest Region Enforcement Support Manager, said:“Most Police Officers are non-anglers and are at a disadvantage when trying to understand angling, the relevant law and, the numerous poaching methods used to take fish illegally.“This practical, very hands on training, in small groups, provides that understanding and develops key contacts and support, which moving forward develops joint working relationships between all parties involved. It encourages joint enforcement patrols between the agencies and provides the angling community with a better service.”A police spokesperson for Cumbria Police said:“We are extremely grateful to the Environment Agency and Angling Trust for providing this training to our officers.“We’d also like to thank Clearwater Fisheries for allowing us to use their facilities for the day to allow officer to be involved in practical workstations.“Illegal fishing is an ongoing issue and we will continue to work in partnership to prevent poaching and, to protect fish, the fishing industry and the environment.”Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 19 November 2021        Related content      SK22 2NP, Mr Mel Cranmer and 3 others: environmental permit application advertisement - EPR/WB3093EA/A001CM1 7TG, Mr William Marriage and Mrs Wendy Marriage: environmental permit application advertisement - EPR/VB3091NJ/A001Forms directions for patents, designs and trade marks ActsExplore the topicFishing regulations, monitoring and enforcementIs this page useful?

We’ve screened for over 1,000 potential chemical contaminants but found no anomalies that could lead to an event of this scale.“Our environment officers have also reviewed environmental permits and scrutinised industrial sites in the Teesside area, but again found no evidence of abnormal discharges that could lead to an event of this scale.“In a bid to better understand the scale of the incident, our survey vessel the Humber Guardian has taken samples from the seabed, which show that that only crabs and lobsters appear to be affected.“By combining this evidence we have ruled out chemical pollution and sewage as likely causes, and the investigation will now focus more on whether disease or a natural event could have been responsible for the deaths.”Mike Gubbins, head of the Fish Health Inspectorate at Cefas, said:“We are continuing to investigate whether an aquatic animal disease has caused this mortality.“Our Fish Health Inspectorate have been analysing shellfish samples collected from the area for listed and other non-listed diseases, but none have been detected so far.“We will continue to work with partner agencies to try and find answers for the local community.”Anyone who finds dead crustaceans (crabs or lobsters) or other dead wildlife, should report them to the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 26 November 2021        Related content      LN7 6HJ, Mr Allen Pike and Mrs Jennifer Pike: environmental permit application advertisement - EPR/WB3393VW/A001Explore the topicMarineIs this page useful?

The team is also working with the education, business, community, sport and fishing sectors.Environment Agency project officer Claire Horrocks said:Working with the NFYFC is a great way to reach young people. Those working in agriculture and related industries have such an important role to play in protecting our environment. We hope these resources will be a fun and inspiring way to help YFC members to think about the plastic they use and the responsibility we all have to reduce unnecessary plastic use and manage our waste properly.NFYFC chairman Rachel Goldie said:We are really excited to be launching these resources for our members with the support of the Environment Agency. Young Farmers’ Clubs are eager to do all they can to help combat climate change and these fun activities will help our members work together to make proactive changes in their local rural communities and on farms to prevent plastic pollution.Outside of its regulatory work, the Environment Agency is an influencer with ambitions to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste, helping to achieve the goals and commitments outlined in its 5 year plan to create better places for people, wildlife and the environment, and the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 22 March 2021Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

At present it passes through the effluent treatment plant operated by the neighbouring nuclear site, Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd. HMNB Devonport now wants to release the rainwater directly into the River Tamar/Hamoaze. This will result in a very minor increase in dose to the public – equal to less than five minutes of the average annual background radiation dose in the UK.Operators of nuclear sites in England must have a permit for activities involving radioactive substances from the Environment Agency. As HMNB Devonport is operated by the Ministry of Defence, it does not need an environmental permit but instead has an  ‘Approval’ from the agency to receive and dispose of radioactive waste as part of submarine operations and maintenance.The operator now wishes to vary this approval to reflect their proposed change to disposing of rainwater.The environmental permitting process is designed to ensure sites are operated without causing significant harm to the environment and human health. The Environment Agency will consult relevant technical experts on the technical detail of the permit variation and invite comments from the public before a decision is made on whether or not to vary the permit.You can view a copy of the application for a variation and supporting documents and comment online at https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/nuclear/application-to-vary-the-radioactive-substances-app/ or email nuclear@environment-agency.gov.uk quoting reference EPR/LB3730DK. Paper copies are available from  our Customer Contact Centre on 03708 506 506. We may charge to cover copying costs.Comments should be sent to the Environment Agency by Tuesday 27 July 2021. Please note we can only consider issues covered by the environmental permit. We will then review all comments before making our final decision on whether or not to vary the approval.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 29 June 2021    Last updated 30 June 2021      + show all updates30 June 2021Edit added to explain the average annual background radiation dose in UK.29 June 2021First published.Explore the topicEnvironmental permitsIs this page useful?

The team has shown an excellent improvement in its wellbeing scores in the Civil Service People Survey over the period 2012 to 2014: the number of people feeling satisfied with their lives rose from 53% in 2012 to 65% in 2014, and the number of people with low levels of anxiety went from 33% to 60% in the same years.The Cabinet Office interviewed three team members and learnt how the simple things they are doing every day - valuing and supporting colleagues and their work, encouraging positive change and being a good role model - can have a positive and tangible impact on staff wellbeing.Be proactive and take action on staff survey resultsThere is confidence within our team that the results will be acted upon. Following previous low scores, an all-staff roundtable was instigated to discuss the results and agree an action plan. We were encouraged to take ownership of the actions, and as a result we have been directly involved in decision making and positive change.The action plan is reviewed every three months and is included in an induction pack for new starters, who are invited to provide feedback.Value team membersFeedback from other team members within the Marine Environment Strategy team has shown that they tend to feel that the work they do is valued, and that their performance is judged according to the quality of their work rather than the processes followed. The team’s work is also valued by senior stakeholders, who listen to and value our opinions and advice even if our points of view differ. Diversity and equality is promoted throughout the team.Good visibility and communication are importantThere are visible role models within the team across all grades and a very clear understanding of responsibilities. The roles of everyone in the team have been well considered and defined, allowing each member to understand how their work contributes to the overall team goals.Managers also cultivate a sense of trust and honesty, by sharing information about what’s happening and being truthful about the state of play. This helps each employee feel part of the team.Promote flexible workingFlexible working is encouraged within the team and allows team members to adapt their working style to suit their personal circumstances, for example by working from home or working compressed hours (e.g. working the same number of hours you’d work over five days in four days).Considering wellbeing brings benefits to the businessDespite a high workload, team members are very supportive of each other and that reduces anxiety and leads to high levels of wellbeing. For example, team leaders try to reduce pressure as much as possible by encouraging staff to push back on unnecessary processes. This ultimately leads to greater efficiency.

These measures are generally divided into three main categories: river and floodplain management; woodland management; and run-off management. Some examples include: tree and hedgerow planting; buffer strips (which trap sediment and slowing water flow); leaky barriers (which enhance floodplain storage); woodland creation; and sediment traps.Fiona Sugden, Environment Agency Project Manager, said:There is a long history of flooding in the Lower Aire catchment which has a huge effect on local residents, the environment and wildlife. The Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme’s Natural Flood Management Programme plays an important role in reducing flood risk and bringing wider environmental and social benefits to the area.The project has seen huge successes so far and we are keen for more landowners to get in touch to find out more about the benefits of introducing natural flood management measures on their land.This scale of natural flood management will provide several wider environmental and social benefits to the area, such as: increasing biodiversity, tree canopy cover and creating habitat for wildlife, capturing and storing carbon, improved land management, better water quality and helping to regenerate rural and urban areas.Ian Coldwell, Project Manager for the White Rose Forest said:This natural flood management project is important for nature, our environment and everyone living in the River Aire catchment. We are working with our network of local White Rose Forest partners to invite interested landowners across the Aire valley to find out more about the support available for natural flood management projects on their land.A complete package of design, funding, and delivery is available to make each project as simple and straight forward as possible for landowners. Although the scheme runs throughout the year, we would encourage landowners to register their interest early via the White Rose Forest website to ensure timely delivery, particularly for popular projects such as tree planting.Councillor Helen Hayden, Leeds City Council’s executive member for infrastructure and climate, said:Natural flood management techniques can play a key role in improving our area’s resilience to climate change. In conjunction with the engineering work being carried out also through the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme it could significantly reduce the flood risk to previously affected residents and businesses in Leeds.The council has an ambitious target of planting up to two million trees, which will contribute significantly to our area’s resilience and we know natural flood management also has environmental benefits, which is why it is so important.As well as reducing flood risk, landowners or land managers could benefit from;improved soil fertility and reductions in soil loss, pesticide and fertiliser runoffreduced effects of dry weatherimproved drainage of waterlogged areasbankside fencing can reduce the risk of waterborne disease and lameness in stockhedges and tree planting can provide shelter and shade for stockreduced erosion of tracks and river banksless need for gravel managementpotential income generation from commercial woodlands and short rotation willow coppiceThis initiative follows on from natural flood management projects recently undertaken by the Environment Agency as part of the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme’s Natural Flood Management Project on behalf of Leeds City Council. Funded by Leeds City Council, this is one of the UK’s largest natural flood management schemes which aims to use natural processes to slow the flow and build a more resilient river catchment that can respond better to extreme weather.Broughton Hall Estate near Skipton is one of the sites where natural flood management techniques are currently being used with support from the White Rose Forest and funding from Defra’s ‘Nature for Climate’ fund. Work so far this year has included restructuring several areas of woodland, installing leaky barriers and land restoration, as well as the creation of up to 110,000 cubic meters of storage space for surface water.If you have land and would like to know more visit the White Rose Forest website on www.whiteroseforest.org/aireriver or email whiteroseforest@kirklees.gov.uk.For more information about the LeedsFAS visit www.leeds.gov.uk/fas.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 5 August 2021Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

These are partnerships between the government and industry on sector-specific issues and can create significant opportunities to boost productivity, employment, innovation and skills.Following a process of early engagement, we are now entering into formal negotiations on a built environment sector deal. While these negotiations will shape the final content of any deal, we expect it to meet overarching government objectives of:delivering more homes and improving housing quality for example through initiatives that support offsite constructionimproving the sector’s productivity through improved access to data and the promotion of PropTechenabling the sector to diversify its workforce through dedicated skills and employment strategies, as well as diversifying its firm base and increasing competitivenesspromoting clean growth and supporting the sector’s transition to low carbonThe built environment sector deal will bring together investors, developers, real estate and asset management, architecture firms, PropTech firms and others upstream in the supply chain. By focusing on these organisations, the built environment sector deal will enable the implementation and delivery of the construction sector deal.The sector is crucial to the UK economy: commercial real estate alone employs over 2 million people either directly or indirectly, and generates around 7% of the country’s GDP, as well as delivering great places to live and work. These factors make it fundamental to delivering the government’s strategic objective, including our ambitious housing targets.

The fine includes a victim surcharge of £900 and costs of £1,300.From:Environment AgencyPublished8 September 2021        Scrapped cars on unmade ground at The Old Coal Yard site in Billingham      Martin Flatman (39) of Bradley Court, Billingham, was sentenced at Teesside Magistrates Court on Tuesday 7 May following a successful prosecution by the Environment Agency.Flatman was found to have been running an illegal car-breaking operation without possessing the appropriate environmental permit. The offences were committed at a site known as The Old Coal Yard, at the junction of Haverton Hill Road and Hope Street, Billingham between 14 May and 13 August 2020. In addition, a separate site, opposite The Old Coal Yard was being used by Flatman to store scrap vehicles, presenting a pollution risk to the nearby Teesmouth and Cleveland Site of Special Scientific Interest.Environment Agency enforcement officers investigated following concerns about pollution made by members of the public to the Environment Agency’s national incident hotline.Waste operators are required to follow the rules and regulations put in place to protect people and the environment. These rules require accurate documentation of the process they follow when transporting waste materials and ensuring those waste materials are disposed of correctly at a waste facility permitted by the Environment Agency. Failure to dispose of waste correctly is a risk to the environment and public health.The Old Coal Yard site is not a permitted waste facility. Scrap cars contain a variety of hazardous waste materials including brake fluids, fuel and oils. Cars were being stored on unmade ground, with evidence that they had been broken apart with a bulldozer.Environment Agency enforcement lead for the north east, John Crowl said:This crude operation increased the risk of hazardous wastes leaching into the environment and presented a risk of pollution to groundwater.Further, Flatman was unable to produce any waste transfer documentation. As a registered waste-carrier he had a statutory duty to maintain written records of all waste collected including the origin, destination, volume and waste classification. It is an offence to fail to comply with these Duty of Care requirements, which are necessary to prove that waste materials have been disposed of correctly.Flatman was instructed by the Environment Agency to stop operating and clear the sites. However, subsequent visits by Environment Agency enforcement officers revealed that illegal waste operations continued to be undertaken in violation of the law.The court found that the offending had been deliberate, committed for financial gain and had undercut lawful operators.The Environment Agency’s John Crowl said:We work hard to prevent and disrupt waste crime and we are delighted that Flatman has admitted wrong-doing in respect of the offences carried out in Billingham. We welcome sentencing by the judge which should act as a deterrent to others considering flouting the law.Any person or business who transports, treats, stores or deposits waste without the required environmental permit is breaking the law.The conditions of an environmental permit are designed to protect people and the environment. Failure to comply with these legal requirements is a serious offence that can damage the environment, undermine local legitimate environmental permit holders, put jobs at risk and cause misery for local communities.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 8 September 2021Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityIs this page useful?

Areas of Gloucestershire around the River Severn, and near the River Avon in Worcestershire and Warwickshire are expected to be affected by flooding today until Monday.More localised flooding is also possible in the east and north-east of England on Sunday, due to the potential for further rain or showers falling on wet ground.Environment Agency teams have been working around the clock to protect communities from flooding. Incident rooms will remain open across the weekend to monitor the unsettled weather forecast due over the weekend.Over 21,000 properties have been protected by flood defences in England, since the flooding began, including nearly 7,000 properties in Yorkshire alone. Other areas protected include:  5, 713 properties in the West Midlands1,000 properties in the East Midlands2,191 properties in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire5,202 properties in the Greater Manchester, Merseyside and CheshireThere are now over 400 EA operational staff and military personnel working 24/7  on flooded sites across Yorkshire assisting with pumping and erecting more temporary barriers to help better protect more homes and businesses against further flooding. We currently have 55 high volume pumps, including two ultra-high volume units,  extracting 22 cubic metres of water per second help protect homes and business in South Yorkshire. If pumping in Fishlake continues at the current rate, the community will be free of floodwater by Sunday.Kate Marks, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency, said:“Communities in northern England, northern and western parts of the Midlands should remain vigilant to the risk of flooding with further rainfall expected over the weekend.“Over 20,000 properties have been protected from flooding thanks to Environment Agency flood schemes. Our teams will continue to work around the clock maintaining flood defences, clearing river blockages, and monitoring river levels“Every flooded home is a personal tragedy and our thoughts are with those who have been affected and those waiting to return to their homes“Our incident rooms remain open 24 hours a day and we are continuing to work closely with local authorities and partners.”The public are advised to stay away from swollen rivers and not to walk or drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.  People can check their flood risk and keep up to date with the latest situation, or by calling Floodline on 0345 988 1188 or following @EnvAgency on Twitter.l-l����Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 15 November 2019        Related content      GLD, AGO and HMCPSI GPC transactions over £500, July 2018Research at OCSExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

The team surveyed the site and provided photographs of illegal activity taking place that could later be used as evidence.An excavator that was initially on site has since been removed, after the Environment Agency’s investigating officer warned the company that had supplied the equipment that any activity on the site was illegal and any plant or vehicle found on the site would be seized.While the machinery has since been removed, the waste, which includes household and construction materials, remains on site. The investigating officer along with the Environment Agency’s National Enforcement Service who followed up the police investigation, are now monitoring the site for signs of any further illegal activity.The land is privately owned and efforts are now being made to notify the landowner of the illegal activity that is taking place. Landowners may be committing an offence by allowing waste to be stored on their land without the relevant permissions, which could leave them liable to prosecution, or they may not be aware of the waste that has been dumped on their land.Gerry Magee, Senior Investigating Crime Officer for the Environment Agency, said:We remain committed during the coronavirus situation to reducing waste crime and reducing the opportunities for those operating illegally to do so.Thanks to the support and assistance from the Warwickshire Rural Crime team we have some good photographic evidence which will help with our investigation into the illegal waste activity near Coleshill.Landowners need to be extra vigilant during the current situation so they don’t get dumped on. Waste criminals could target their land so landowners should make regular checks to make sure it’s secure.Our advice to homeowners and businesses, as always, is to check someone is registered to take your waste away as you could be breaking the law if your waste isn’t managed properly.To report illegal waste activity, or if you suspect a company is operating illegally, call the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60 or report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.Notes to editorsAn illegal waste site is any site routinely operating without a permit or outside of its permit limits. They pose a risk of harm to the health of people and the environment.Check a waste carrier, broker or dealer is registered before you use them.Waste site operators should make sure their site is legal and check they have the right permit for their activities.It is illegal to burn most types of waste. Burning waste such as treated wood, tyres, plastics, rubber and oil can seriously harm health and pollute the environment. People face a fine of up to £50,000 for illegally managing waste.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 30 June 2020Explore the topicWaste and recyclingIs this page useful?

This helps improve connectivity through the landscape for wildlife such as dormice and birds that rely on them for refuge, and bats that use them to navigate.Trees and hedgerows provide many benefits: they create vital habitat for small mammals, birds and insects; increase local biodiversity; ‘lock-in’ carbon, and contribute to improving human health and wellbeing, especially where they are associated with recreational access.LORP’s extensive planting scheme continues to create more woodland and offsets the removal of some mature trees earlier in the project.Vegetation was initially cleared to provide the open estuarine habitat necessary to attract waders and other key bird species (wading birds need far-reaching views to enable them to be able to feed without being predated). Vegetation has also now effectively been relocated to areas around the site where it will not be adversely affected by saltwater re-entering the historic floodplain or snag debris.Dan Boswell of the Environment Agency said:This is another big step forward for the project and our efforts to restore the Lower Otter Valley to a more natural state. The planting addresses some of the ecological and environmental challenges we have in the area and will play an important role in enhancing local biodiversity and visitor’s experiences.It is early days, but the Lower Otter Restoration Project is already having clear positive effects on the valley’s ability to attract more and more varied birdlife, and as these saplings grow and the newly restored wetlands develop, this will greatly increase.The Lower Otter Restoration Project is an intertidal habitat restoration project delivered by the Environment Agency in partnership with the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths Conservation Trust and Clinton Devon Estates. It is part of a cross-border initiative called ‘Promoting Adaptation to Changing Coasts’ (PACCo) and is delivering climate change adaptation by working with nature to provide benefits for people and the environment.Work includes a 70-metre breach in embankments to reconnect the Otter Estuary to its historic floodplain; restoring 55 hectares of wetland habitat; the construction of a 30-metre span flood resilient, raised road and road bridge, as well as a new footbridge over the location of the future breach to ensure continuity of the South West Coast Path; the relocation of Budleigh Salterton Cricket Club away from the floodplain; raising and improving public footpaths, and creating wildlife viewing areas.To find out more about the Lower Otter Restoration Project, visit: www.lowerotterrestorationproject.co.uk.For more information on the PACCo initiative, visit: www.pacco-interreg.com.BackgroundThe LORP project is the English arm of the Anglo-French venture Promoting Adaptation to Changing Coasts (PACCo). It has been majority funded by the UK government, with £8.5 million of co-financing from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V A France (Channel) England programme (2021 to 2023). As part of the initiative, work is also going ahead on a similar project in the Saâne valley in Normandy.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 17 April 2023Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionBirdsPlantsIs this page useful?

However, there is still a high risk that water levels will overtop the barrier.The Environment Agency issues Severe Flood Warnings when there is imminent risk of flooding and threat to life.  Residents are strongly urged to evacuate their homes during the flood and are being supported by the police and councils.Environment Agency Area Duty Manager for Worcestershire Gary Bywater said:We are facing a significant flood risk at Beales Corner in Bewdley and urging people to remain vigilant and take extreme care. Heavy rain, affecting already wet areas, is likely to cause significant river flooding along the River Severn for several days.We have teams out on the ground taking preventative action and we are working with other agencies to support people who need to evacuate their homes.We advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water as just 30 centimetres of flowing water is enough to move your car.The Environment Agency has been working with local authorities over the past year to ensure that excellent resilient measures are in place should the barrier need to be deployed, including re-surfacing the road and maintaining the drains.Residents are urged to sign up to Environment Agency Flood Warning messages and to make sure they are prepared for flooding by following the ‘Prepare, Act, Survive’ guidance:Prepare a bag that includes medical and insurance documentsCheck the latest flood situation onlineKnow how to turn off your gas, electricity and waterCheck your insurance to make sure you are covered for flood damage. If you rent your home, it is your responsibility to have insurance for your belongingsIf you are flooded, call 999 if in immediate danger and follow advice from emergency services.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 21 February 2022        Related content      Preliminary flood risk assessment for EnglandFlood warnings: what they are and what to doThe Thames BarrierPersonal flood planFlooding from groundwaterExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

The company was fined a total of £120,000 and ordered to pay costs of £28,125.19.Officers from the Environment Agency were first alerted to the situation in February 2018 when members of the public discovered dead fish in Piddle Brook near Redditch.An investigation discovered a faulty pipe had started to discharge anaerobic digestate into the watercourse from nearby Rotherdale Farm, which is run by the company.Officers were told that the company used a lagoon to store digestate and used an underground pump system to spread liquid as a fertiliser. Around 220 dead fish were discovered in Piddle Brook and another 100 at a marina further down the watercourse.Farm employees said they did not maintain records of the volumes in the lagoon and had no maintenance record either of the lagoon or pipework.A further offence was recorded in May of 2018 when company officials notified the Environment Agency that foam had been reported in Piddle Brook.An investigation revealed that sugar beet discharge, being used to irrigate a field, had started to spill into the watercourse from a faulty pipe.No dead fish were recorded on this occasion and the farm took immediate steps to fix the faulty pipe.The initial investigation had prompted the Environment Agency to ask the company for levels of nitrates used on the farm.Regulations were introduced in 2015 aimed at farms limiting the amounts of nitrogen used on land in an effort to prevent the pollution of ground and surface waters.However, the company admitted there was no nitrogen fertiliser plan in accordance with the regulations. It was subsequently discovered that 19 fields had been treated with amounts of nitrogen that exceeded the 250kilogram/hectare limit.It is important all organisations take action to avoid polluting the environment through careful consideration of their processes and procedures, and the monitoring of operations.A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said:We always strive to work with farmers to reduce the risk of pollution, protect the environment, and ensure they are compliant with the regulations.However, where there is evidence of serious pollution issues we will not hesitate to pursue the offenders concerned and take tough enforcement action.We expect much better from such a large and experienced farming business, both for the environment and the local community.If people are concerned about impacts on the environment, they should contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour incident line on 0800 807060.Offences/chargesBetween 12 and 14 February 2018, Springhill Farms (Pershore) Limited caused a water discharge activity, namely a discharge of anaerobic digestate into a tributary of the Piddle Brook, Wyre Piddle, when not authorised by an environmental permit to do so, contrary to Regulation 38(1)(a) and Regulation 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.On 18 May 2018 Springhill Farms (Pershore) Limited caused a water discharge activity, namely a discharge of sugar beet washings into a tributary of the Piddle Brook, Wyre Piddle, when not authorised by an environmental permit to do so, contrary to Regulation 38(1)(a) and Regulation 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.Springhill Farms (Pershore) Limited, between 1 June 2015 and 1 June 2017, being the occupier of a holding in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone, namely Springhill Farm, failed to comply with the requirements of Regulation 8 of The Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2015, in that in respect of each field listed in the Schedule of Offences below, it failed to ensure that in any 12 month period the total amount of nitrogen in organic manure spread on any given hectare of land on the holding did not exceed 250kg, and each and every contravention listed in the Schedule of Offences below was a separate offence contrary to Regulation 41(1)(a) of the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2015:Springhill Farms (Pershore) Limited, between 1 June 2015 and 1 June 2017, being the occupier of a holding in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone, namely Rotherdale Farm, failed to comply with the requirements of Regulation 8 of The Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2015, in that in respect of each field listed in the Schedule of Offences below, it failed to ensure that in any 12 month period the total amount of nitrogen in organic manure spread on any given hectare of land on the holding did not exceed 250kg, and each and every contravention listed in the Schedule of Offences below was a separate offence contrary to Regulation 41(1)(a) of the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2015.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 31 May 2022    Last updated 31 May 2022      + show all updates31 May 2022First published.Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityIs this page useful?

However, there is still a high risk that some water will breach the top of the defence.The Environment Agency issues Severe Flood Warnings when there is imminent risk of flooding and threat to life.  Residents are strongly urged to evacuate their homes in advance of the flood and are being supported by the police and councils.Environment Agency Area Duty Manager for Shropshire Jim Kitchen said:We are facing a significant flood risk in Ironbridge and urging people to remain vigilant and take extreme care. Heavy rain, affecting already wet areas, is likely to cause significant river flooding along the River Severn for several days.We have teams out on the ground taking preventative action and we are working with other agencies to support people who need to evacuate their homes.We advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water as just 30 centimetres of flowing water is enough to move your car.Residents are urged to sign up to Environment Agency Flood Warning messages and to make sure they are prepared for flooding by following the ‘Prepare, Act, Survive’ guidance:Prepare a bag that includes medical and insurance documentsCheck the latest flood situation onlineKnow how to turn off your gas, electricity and waterCheck your insurance to make sure you are covered for flood damage. If you rent your home, it is your responsibility to have insurance for your belongingsIf you are flooded, call 999 if in immediate danger and follow advice from emergency services.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 21 February 2022        Related content      The Thames BarrierFlood warnings: what they are and what to doPreliminary flood risk assessment for EnglandFarming and the Environment AgencyHampshire: groundwater situationExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

This did not increase flood risk to the community but left the defence susceptible to damage in future wet weather events.Emergency works were carried out by Environment Agency contractors and involved the use of a crane to place stone bags in the river in front of the flood wall.  This helps to prevent erosion and undermining of the wall during future high flows, ahead of any permanent works in future. A temporary flood defence has also been installed in the old police station yard.Environment Agency’s Matt Crump, Operations Manager for Cumbria said:“Wet weather on the 28th October last year gave us significant rainfall in a short period of time and our thoughts remain with those who may be still affected.“After the flood water subsided, we inspected all of our assets and flood defences and quickly put plans in place to repair any damages. I am delighted to see that the initial works in Cockermouth have now been completed. This was a significant repair which has allowed us to strengthen the town’s flood defences while we explore more permanent solutions.”“With winter upon us, I would also like to take the opportunity to highlight how vital it is that everyone knows how flooding can affect them and how to keep loved ones, property and possession safe. Go to the Gov.uk website or search ‘know my flood risk’ to sign up for Environment Agency flood warnings, receive information on the risk in your area and what to do in a flood.”To keep up to date with Environment Agency’s work in the North West follow us on our Twitter account @EnvAgencyNWShare this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 12 January 2022Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Experts say that 50% of all plastic produced is for single-use items – items that are often only used a few times and then discarded, which may pollute rivers and oceans, causing harm to wildlife.Environment Agency project lead Hannah Amor said:Everyone has a part to play in minimising their avoidable plastic consumption and carbon footprint to help conserve the natural world.Sport can influence thousands of people that may otherwise not engage with environmental issues. Three billion people watched the Tokyo Olympics. That is a huge platform to showcase sustainability and make it the new norm for people taking part in and watching sport.We hope this campaign will encourage people from all walks of life involved in sport to take even the smallest step, like wearing a hydration belt or carrying a resuable cup. Collectively, changing our daily habits can make a huge difference.The toolkit includes twice-weekly posts encouraging deposit return schemes, re-wearing old kit and avoiding single-use plastic waste at celebrations. The posts also signpost to new sustainability guidance for sports events, stadiums and community clubs, and encourage people to sign up to the Big Plastic Pledge - a global movement founded by Olympic gold medallist Hannah Mills.The campaign will also run on the Interreg Preventing Plastic Pollution Twitter feed at @Plastic_EU, with the first post going live on Friday 1 July (tomorrow).Plastic Free July is a global movement that helps millions of people be part of the solution to plastic pollution. It was launched by the Plastic Free Foundation which aims to see a world free of plastic waste.Notes to editorsEnvironment Agency roleAs a regulator, preventing waste plastic entering the environment by cracking down on waste crime and poor waste management is a key activity for the Environment Agency. As an influencer, it also has an ambition to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste, helping to achieve the goals and commitments outlined in its five year plan to create better places for people and wildlife, and the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan.Preventing Plastic Pollution (PPP)PPP is a €14million funded EU INTERREG VA France (Channel) England Programme project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund which works mainly across  pilot catchments: Brest Harbour, Bay of Douarnenez, Bay of Veys, Test and Itchen, East Hampshire, Poole Harbour,  Medway, Tamar, and the Great Ouse catchments.Working in partnership with 18 organisations from across France and England, PPP seeks to understand and reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in the river and marine environments. By looking at the catchment from source to sea, the project identifies and targets hotspots for plastic, embeds behaviour change in local communities and businesses, and implement effective solutions and alternatives.Partners are the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Queen Mary University of London, LABOCEA Conseil, Expertise et Analyses, Syndicat mixte établissement public de gestion et d’aménagement de la baie de Douarnenez, Office Français De La Biodiversité, Parc naturel marin d’Iroise, Brest Métropole, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Counseil départemental de la Manche, Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, The Rivers Trust, Syndicat de bassin de l’Elorn, ACTIMAR, Brest’aim, Westcountry Rivers Trust, South East Rivers Trust, and Plymouth City Council.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 30 June 2022Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

The QR code is mounted on them or nearby in 4 locations, with a fifth to be added later this year.Liz Taylor, flood resilience engagement advisor, said:Finding new and interesting ways to engage people is key. And using Hello Lamp Post technology will help make us more relevant to a newer audience who prefer texting.But the advice being shared through our growing network is relevant to everyone. How to stay safe in a flood. How defences work. And ways to start making lifestyle changes to cut down on plastic waste from our in-house team of experts.We also hope to add advice on saving water from South West Water in the future. If you see one of QR codes during the school holiday, try it.Interactive objects can be found at:Bude where signs give information about the flood risk in the area and the changing coast line, as well as a fun plastics quiz;Dartmoor which has signs in Buckfastleigh and on Dartmoor so people can find out more about how working with natural processes on the moor can reduce the impact of flooding on communities;Exmouth where people can learn more about the recently completed tidal defence scheme and plastic pollution;Truro which is a terrific location to learn what the tidal gate does and how to prepare for a flood.Jessica Hickie, plastics and sustainability programme manager, said:Be part of the solution during Plastic Free July 2022. Chat with the signs at Exmouth. Learn the simple actions you could take to tackle plastic pollution in your day to day life and protect our wildlife.The actions include a simple litter pick, kitchen refills and finding out about a hard-to-recycle item. They have been put together by the Environment Agency on behalf of the Interreg Preventing Plastic Pollution. The project which aims to understand and reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in river and marine environments via behaviour change, targeting hotspots and finding effective solutions.Editor’s notesAcross Devon and Cornwall there are 45 signs. Since they have been installed the number of interactions is the equivalent of holding around 40 public engagement events. They have helped us save nearly 5 tonnes of carbon.The next location to be added is East Budleigh where people can find out more about the Lower Otter Restoration Project.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 27 July 2022Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Since then, the Environment Agency has continued to regulate the site, ensuring monitoring and maintenance of the site is managed in accordance with the site’s environmental permit.The solar farm, which at 11 hectares, is the size of around 22 football pitches and is due to be operational by summer this year, even though the site will not be fully complete by this time. It is estimated that the solar energy will power the hospital for three quarters of the year – around 288 days of self-generated renewable energy.Joe Craddock, Environment Officer at the Environment Agency said:It’s fantastic to see a former landfill being used in this way to provide a renewable energy source for the hospital.We have taken the opportunity of working with the council to not only maintain but also improve the infrastructure of the closed landfill. We have required City of Wolverhampton Council to review and improve the leachate and gas wells on the site and make updates to the gas flare.*We will continue to monitor and manage the site as it changes its use into a new source of renewable energy.The improvements to the landfill infrastructure are important as they reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses being emitted from the site.Background informationThe solar farm is located approximately 1 mile to the north-east of Wolverhampton city centre and approximately 0.5 mile south of Wednesfield village centre.The solar farm is planned to produce 6.9 megawatts-peak per annum which will be fed direct to New Cross Hospital. New Cross Hospital will be the first hospital in England to fully utilise and operate its own facility providing renewable energy.The repository at Bowmans Harbour is the subject of an existing environmental permit issued to City of Wolverhampton Council by the Environment Agency in respect of environmental monitoring.The Environment Agency regulates the environmental permits held by a landfill operator, including a closed landfill.  Within the environmental permits there are conditions controlling the operations that the site can carry out, which cover emission limits and the location and frequency of environmental monitoring.The conditions of the environmental permit are designed to prevent pollution and minimise impacts to the environment and human health.  Appropriate measures are required to be taken by the holder of the environmental permit through the application of best practice.There is a long-term monitoring contract in place with City of Wolverhampton Council to meet the conditions of the environmental permit.Less potent greenhouse gasses are emitted if the landfill gas is burnt as opposed to being vented* so reducing the volume of gas being vented on the site will have a positive effect on the environment in terms of the greenhouse gases being emitted by the site.When the gas is vented, a higher percentage of methane is released to the atmosphere which has a greater greenhouse effect. Burning the landfill gas reduces the volume of more potent greenhouse gases being released.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 8 February 2022        Related content      Safety lessons: assisting pilots to ensure safe passage for shipsAttitudes of the over 50s to fuller working livesBetter leadership for tomorrow: NHS leadership reviewTribunal Patents ManualFuller Working Lives: a framework for actionExplore the topicEnvironmental permitsIs this page useful?

The event also raises funds for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 22 December 2021Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityIs this page useful?

When the river rises, the reservoir helps to prevent flooding by storing excess water until the river level returns to normal.Following a site inspection, some mandatory works were identified as needing to be carried out to bring the reservoir in line with new safety regulations. These include upgrading the existing structure of the reservoir and extending and re-profiling the adjacent spillway. Other works include erosion protection of the downstream slope of the reservoir to provide additional strength to the embankment.Richard Bentley, Environment Agency Operations Manager for the West Midlands said:Following a recent site inspection we are carrying out improvements to increase the resilience of the reservoir to higher safety standards. Work started on the reservoir earlier this year and should be completed by the end of autumn.  We’re delighted to also be able to make some enhancements to the wider site including creating new habitats and planting wildflower for pollinators.As part of the scheme, the Environment Agency is providing a range of environmental enhancements to the area including covering the reinforced dam with wildflower grassland to attract bees and create habitats. More than 250 trees will also be planted in parks in the local area.Members of the public are still able to access the nature reserve at the site while the works are underway. A diversion is also in place for cyclists who use National Cycle Route 5 which runs by the reservoir.Background informationTo protect members of public and comply with health and safety procedures, the road linking the park to the adjacent industrial estate will be temporarily closed for the duration of the works. This stretch of the road alongside the embankment is also part of a national cycling route, so the relevant partners have been notified and a temporary diversion route for the cycle path has been arranged.The nature reserve will still be accessible through a fenced corridor from Wychall Lane at the site entrance, before following the line of the wall and along the river. Appropriate fencing is in place, although residents were asked to keep dogs and young children under constant supervision/control whilst the works are carried out. Traffic Marshals will be on site at all times to control traffic movements accessing the site from Wychall Lane.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 8 July 2022Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Due to the current low water flows there are fish stranded in pools and if left, these pools will dry out, and the fish will be lost.Environment Agency officers will be doing regular monitoring of the area and taking appropriate action during the continued spell of dry weather.Those enjoying our environment, such as anglers and boaters are being encouraged to report environmental incidents. Warm weather can often lead to algal blooms or water that is too warm which makes it difficult for fish to breathe. Fish are often seen gasping for air. If anyone sees fish in distress, please contact the Environment Agency’s incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 17 June 2022Explore the topicFreshwater fisheriesIs this page useful?

They focus on food waste, candles and decorations, and fireworks.Environment Agency project lead Claire Horrocks said:Sikh families from across the world will soon come together to mark Bandi Chhor Divas (4 November) – an important festival in the Sikh calendar that coincides with climate change conference COP26 this year.What better time to share positive ideas for sustainable celebrations and encourage people to reduce waste. Regardless of faith, everyone can learn from the messages in these posters, be kinder to our planet, and help protect the environment from further harm caused by plastic pollution.Eco-Sikh representative Amandeep Kaur Maan said:This is an important collaboration between the Environment Agency and Sikh communities all over the UK to help get the message about climate change out there.Bandi Chhor Divas is a time to reflect on how our actions affect the world. Just as our Guru demonstrated selflessness in the way he helped others, we too should carry his message forward. This is by being responsible when celebrating so that we don’t harm the environment.Environment Agency Sikh Fellowship representative Jatinder Singh Mehmi said:The Sikh Fellowship represents Sikh colleagues within the Environment Agency who want to play an active part in promoting sustainable celebrations to their family, friends and their wider community. We’re delighted to be working with Eco-Sikh UK in this endeavour.In future, the Environment Agency’s plastics and sustainability team also hopes to highlight festivals from other faiths, including Hindu and Jewish celebrations.As a regulator, the Environment Agency prevents waste plastic entering the environment by cracking down on waste crime and poor waste management. As an influencer, its ambition is to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste, helping to achieve the goals and commitments outlined in its 5 year plan to create better places for people, wildlife and the environment, and the government’s 25 year environment plan.The Environment Agency is also a member of Preventing Plastic Pollution - a partnership of 18 organisations in England and France, aiming to reduce the impact of plastic pollution in river and marine environments, which includes embedding behaviour change in local communities.Notes to editorsInterreg Preventing Plastic Pollution: Working in partnership with 18 organisations from across France and England, Preventing Plastic Pollution (PPP) seeks to understand and reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in the river and marine environments. By looking at the catchment from source to sea, the project will identify and target hotspots for plastic, embed behaviour change in local communities and businesses, and implement effective solutions and alternatives.PPP is a €14million funded EU INTERREG VA France (Channel) England Programme project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund which works mainly across seven pilot sites: Brest Harbour, Bay of Douarnenez, Bay of Veys, Poole Harbour, and the Medway, Tamar, and Great Ouse estuaries.Partners are the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Queen Mary University of London, LABOCEA Conseil, Expertise et Analyses, Syndicat mixte établissement public de gestion et d’aménagement de la baie de Douarnenez, Office Français De La Biodiversité, Parc naturel marin d’Iroise, Brest Métropole, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Counseil départemental de la Manche, Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, The Rivers Trust, Syndicat de bassin de l’Elorn, ACTIMAR, Brest’aim, Westcountry Rivers Trust, South East Rivers Trust, and Plymouth City Council.Eco-Sikh UK: Eco-Sikh UK is a unified inter-faith response to help combat climate change, global warming and bio-diversity loss. Eco-Sikh UK is a non-profit organisation which is part of a wider global climate action programme by Eco-Sikh – the Sikh community’s contribution to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC) Plans for Generational Change Project.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 21 October 2021Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

The temporary defences that were constructed during the February 2020 floods have been reconstructed to provide the same level of protection to properties.Once completed, this phase of the scheme, will see a permanent 2.5m flood wall built at the rear of properties in Parkside Close, and a 3m-high earth embankment on the far side of the park with football pitches acting as a natural floodplain. Work in Close Park will also include the creation of new wildlife habitat and increased amenity areas for the public including a £150,000 extension to the junior football club building which is coming out of the £2m contribution to the scheme from Bury Council.Peter Costello, Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager said: “We are doing all we can to ensure work continues as much as is safe to do so and that delays caused by the knock-on effects of this pandemic are kept to an absolute minimum. Our contractors on site, BMM JV have continued to construct Phase 1 of the Radcliffe and Redvales scheme. The team is working in line with Public Health England advice, and have had to reassess the work they can do safely without putting their workforce at any increased risk of Covid-19.“As government advice changes daily, the construction process must alter to allow for safe practice, the pace may slow and the number of workforce on the site may be reduced and as such, the effects on the programme are continuously changing. Our priority in these difficult times is the health, safety and wellbeing of residents, staff and construction workers. Unfortunately, due to the number of unknown factors we are unable to provide a revised end date to Phase 1 at this time and we hope residents will understand and appreciate that we are continuing to do what we can in these unusual circumstances.“The effect which the Coronavirus situation will have on the scheme is still unclear and will depend on developments over the next days and weeks. If our plans change significantly due to the situation we will keep the community informed. As an organisation we are doing everything we can to support our community, our government and the NHS by abiding by these measures.”In light of the Coronavirus situation, the project team are reviewing the planned start of construction works for Phase 2 of the scheme. Work was due to start on site this month. The Environment Agency is working together with the scheme contractors to understand what operations can safely be progressed in light of the current Government restrictions. If it is deemed a safety risk to be starting new construction works, then affected works will be postponed.Mr Costello said the project team are moving ahead with other tasks that will ensure a swift site setup when the time comes to restart construction. Including working to discharge planning application conditions, agreeing entry arrangements with landowners, tree removal and reviewing and approving detailed designs. The dates for when construction will begin are being reviewed as the situation with regards COVID-19 changes.He also confirmed that while the project team are currently going through a period of readjustment to widespread home working, systems are being put in place to support this. Residents can still contact FloodResilienceGMMC@environment-agency.gov.uk with any questions they may have around the scheme’s progress.Bury Council’s Cabinet Member for the Environment, Cllr Alan Quinn said “We were hoping to see the start of Phase 2 of the scheme start especially in light of the floods that affected Redvales in February, however I’m sure local residents will understand that construction cannot continue as normal due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Residents can be assured though that we will be doing all we can, working in conjunction with the Environment Agency and residents to get the flood defences finished.”The Environment Agency encourage people to ensure they are prepared prior to flooding taking place.

Gloucestershire Police are aware and will be monitoring the site, and the Environment Agency will continue to check the CCTV.Water in reservoirs is very cold, much colder than the sea or a river.  Water in reservoirs is so cold that it causes cold-water shock which can immobilise your arms and legs which means you won’t be able to move them to stay afloat.  It can also cause hypothermia which can kill.Reservoirs are also big storage tanks for water which have equipment under the surface which sucks the water to the treatment works.  If you are in the water when the equipment starts, you will be dragged deep below the surface.Anthony Perry, Operations Manager West for the Environment Agency, said:Swimming in reservoirs is very dangerous which is why the area is fenced off from the public and clearly signed. The water is deep and can contain hidden hazards so could cause serious injury. Entering the water is a risk to people’s lives.Due to numerous reports of people accessing the area by climbing over the wall, we have installed CCTV cameras as a further deterrent. The police are also aware and will be monitoring the site.There is a public footpath the other side of the wall to the reservoir which walkers are welcome to use, but people should not scale the wall.  All areas around the reservoir are private and out of bounds for all except our own staff and the emergency services.Notes to editorsDowdeswell reservoir is located off the Old Bath Road, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.Many coastal waters and a few inland lakes known to be popular swimming locations are designated as bathing waters. Bathing waters are monitored and protected from sources of pollution known to be a risk to bathers’ health. The Environment Agency monitors over 400 designated bathing waters in England between May and September, and each is given an annual classification of Excellent, Good, Sufficient or Poor.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 23 June 2020Explore the topicAccess to the countrysideIs this page useful?

The scheme will create 55 hectares of mudflats, saltmarsh and other valuable estuarine habitats.LORP is a partnership between the Environment Agency, local landowner Clinton Devon Estates and the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths Conservation Trust that currently manages the estuary.The Environment Agency has submitted plans to East Devon District Council on behalf of LORP as the £15 million project enters its final phase. Success rests on the project gaining planning approval. A marine licence application has also been submitted to the Marine Management Organisation (MMO). If successful, work will start next year and be completed by spring 2023.The Lower Otter project is largely funded by the European Interreg programme through an initiative called Promoting Adaptation to Changing Coasts (PACCo). It is partnered with a similar project in the Saâne Valley in Normandy, France. Both schemes aim to demonstrate that early adaptation to climate change brings greater benefits than a delayed response or inaction. If successful, the adaptation model for these two projects will be rolled out to other locations in the UK and France.The Lower Otter estuary lies within the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The planning application is the culmination of 7 years of public consultation, careful planning and detailed discussions between a wide range of stakeholders.Although much loved, the Lower Otter Valley has been heavily modified by human hand in the last 200 years with the construction of an embankment, a road, a rubbish tip, an aqueduct and an old railway line. These structures are difficult and expensive to maintain and restrict natural processes including the movement of water. This reduces habitat quality and diversity. Since the creation of an embankment in the early 19th century, the River Otter has been disconnected from much of its original floodplain.The creation of new habitats and restoration of the site will be achieved by breaching the embankment that currently separates agricultural land and Budleigh Salterton Cricket Club from the river and estuary. This will allow a much greater extent of the original floodplain to flood at high tide and drain at low tide producing important mudflats and saltmarsh for wading birds. There will also be areas of reedbed and grazing marsh.Once established, the new site will become a wildlife reserve of international importance within 5 years. By working in partnership and sharing common aims for the Lower Otter Valley, the Environment Agency, Clinton Devon Estates and East Devon Pebblebed Heaths Conservation Trust hope the aspirations of all 3 organisations can be fulfilled.Dr Sam Bridgewater, head of Wildlife and Conservation at Clinton Devon Estates, said:The planning application is a major step for the project which arose initially from the Estate looking for ways to manage the area in a sustainable way for people and wildlife in the face of climate change and rising sea levels.We have worked very closely with a wide range of stakeholders who have helped us reach this milestone and we are grateful for their input over the years. We had hoped to hold a public exhibition to share these plans with local people but the Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to rule this out.Instead we will be outlining our proposals on the project website and hope to be able to answer any questions people may have online. People will be able to comment on the applications in the usual way via East Devon District Council and the Marine Management Organisation websites.Mark Rice, Environment Manager for the Environment Agency, said:Climate change is affecting the way we manage our coasts and estuaries and we must adapt to that change. The Lower Otter Restoration Project will provide an example of how we can do that. We hope that our vision for more sustainable management of the Otter Estuary will be supported and that by working in partnership we can deliver long term benefits for people and wildlife.This is the Lower Otter Restoration Project website.Note to editorsThe idea for the Lower Otter Restoration Project initially rose from a desire by Clinton Devon Estates to manage the Lower Otter Valley as sustainably as possible in the face of a rapidly changing climate. It believes climate change threatens coastal communities and that early adaptation is more cost effective and will bring greater benefits to local people and wildlife than a delayed response or inaction.The Environment Agency’s involvement in the project stems from a need to provide compensatory habitat for losses identified in the Exe Estuary Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy. Under EU Habitats Regulations, the Environment Agency has a statutory responsibility to replace intertidal habitat lost through coastal defence improvements carried out in response to rising sea levels.The project includes the relocation of Budleigh Salterton Cricket Club that is prone to flooding. Planning permission has been granted for the club to be moved to a new site. An old refuse tip which currently lies in the floodplain and is an environmental liability will be protected from erosion with an additional pedestrian access route created. The breach in the embankment will be bridged to allow continued access along the South West Coast Path. The project also includes the raising of South Farm Road to safeguard future access for businesses and local residents.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 8 October 2020Explore the topicEnvironmentIs this page useful?

Although a fantastic and natural occurrence, the spawning activity is also associated with many of those fish dying after they have successfully spawned, having completed their natural life cycle.Many of the fish endure a long and arduous journey, and in the case of the salmon – they often go months without feeding and needing to rely on stored body fats to survive. They are likely to have successfully spawned before they die, giving life to future generations of salmon and sea trout.There is no need to remove the dead fish from the water as they will continue to fertilise the river as they decay, and naturally boost its productivity.Other reports may include the fish being described as lethargic, splashing around, and very commonly showing large white cotton wool shaped patches on their skin, which are signs of a common fungal infection.This fungus is naturally present in cold freshwater and is usually associated with fish that have had experienced some physical damage during their long migration journey. Again this is a natural occurrence and although unsightly, these fish may also successfully spawn and should be left in the river.Our fisheries team rely on the general public to report any fish deaths to the Environment Agency with the information helping officers gauge spawning activity and locations, as well as, giving a broad indication about the size of the returning run of adult fish. It is also important to rule out any other potential causes of death such as pollution events.Any photographic evidence of the reported fish incidents that people are able to record is always greatly appreciated.It is very important that any incidents of dead fish are reported to the Environment Agency by calling the emergency hotline number 0800 80 70 60, to enable any appropriate action to be taken by our officers.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 7 December 2020        Related content      DfT: spending over £500 on a GPC for July 2014UK business sectors: indicators of concentrationRegisters – statutory return (RLA-02)Shares and securities – statutory return (SEC-01)Income belonging to others - statutory return (IBO-01)Explore the topicWildlife and animal welfareIs this page useful?

One of the main reasons for their decline was thought to be due to Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing.The Prince of Wales wrote to the then Fisheries Minister, following a letter about the work of the High Seas Task Force (HSTF). The HSTF emerged in 2003 from the Round Table on Sustainable Development. This committee of ministerial representatives from a small group of countries was formed to address the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on the high seas, a practice which was adversely affecting albatross numbers.

As part of that work, the CMA found that businesses needed more clarity about what is, and what is not, legal when working together towards sustainability goals.Brexit has also offered an opportunity for the CMA to go further than it has before in providing reassurance to businesses and clarity on the CMA’s enforcement approach in relation to environmental sustainability agreements.The CMA’s proposed new guidance, published today in draft form for consultation, explains how competition law applies to environmental sustainability agreements between firms operating at the same level of the supply chain.  The new guidance will help businesses take action on climate change and environmental sustainability generally, without undue fear of breaching competition rules.Sarah Cardell, CMA chief executive, said:“Tackling climate change and promoting environmental sustainability are priorities for the CMA and many businesses across the UK. We hear increasingly that firms want to do more to co-operate and tackle climate change issues but are worried that competition law may prevent or impede them from working together to address them. We are committed to helping these businesses deal with the issue together, without unfounded fear of breaking competition rules.“The draft guidance goes further than we have done previously. It gives firms greater certainty about when agreements that genuinely contribute to addressing climate change will be exempt from competition law. Businesses involved in agreements promoting environmental sustainability should also be assured that if they have concerns, they can speak to us, and we can provide bespoke advice.”Sarah Cardell announced plans for this guidance at a speech at the Scottish Competition Forum in January. In its draft annual plan for 2023/24, published in December 2022, the CMA also set out that supporting the UK’s transition to net zero is one of its key aims for the upcoming year.In the draft guidance, the CMA has provided clear working examples that businesses can use to inform and shape their own decisions when working with other companies on environmental sustainability initiatives. It explains that the CMA is likely to look favourably on agreements that are in line with the guidance and is very unlikely to prioritise them for enforcement action. The draft guidance also invites parties to approach the CMA for informal advice, in what it is calling an ‘open-door policy’.The draft guidance published today is part of a wider range of documents on horizontal agreements between businesses. This follows work from the CMA’s Sustainability Taskforce after it published its environmental sustainability advice to the Government in March 2022.For more information and to respond to the consultation, which is open until 11 April 2023, visit the draft guidance on enviromental sustainability agreements page.Notes to editors:To discuss initiatives on environmental sustainability, please get in touch with the Sustainability Taskforce via sustainabilitytaskforce@cma.gov.uk.For media queries, please contact the press office via press@cma.gov.uk or on 020 3738 6460.In line with its new strategy, there are three ways the CMA can help accelerate the transition to a net zero economy. These are helping ensuring: i) that markets for environmentally sustainable products or services develop in competitive ways (see for example the market study on electric vehicle charging points), ii) that consumers make informed choices about the climate impact of the goods and services they use (see the work on green claims), and iii) that competition law is not an unnecessary barrier to companies seeking to pursue environmental sustainability initiatives. The proposed new guidance is about this third area of focus.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 28 February 2023Explore the topicCompetition lawIs this page useful?

He was ordered to pay fines and costs of £22,170.Moody ran three companies in the West Midlands - Berkswell Recycling Limited, Hollybush Recycling Limited and Lodgewood Recycling Limited – who were each ordered to pay fines and costs of £13,070. All the sites stored excessive amounts of wood, for a prolonged period which posed serious fire and health risks.The court heard that Moody headed up Jack Moody Recycling Ltd, of Warstone Road, Wolverhampton, which was an umbrella company for his group.Though officers from the Environment Agency offered frequent advice, Moody did not heed warnings about how he was failing to meet the regulations.The warnings escalated in September 2017 when the defendant acknowledged that they were operating outside the limits.Conditions at the site continued to present unacceptable risks to the environment.Officers found that at the Lodgewood site, near Telford, stockpiles of wood were so large that there was no space to quarantine waste in the event of a fire and insufficient fire breaks.At the Berkswell site, near Hampton-in-Arden, it was estimated there was in excess of 5,000 tonnes rather than the permitted amount of 1,620 tonnes.Both shredded and unshredded wood were mixed in the stockpiles, increasing the potential for self-combustion.At the Hollybush site, near Cannock, huge stockpiles of waste wood were situated on an area of the site which had no concrete surfacing to prevent pollution of the ground.All three companies were served with Enforcement Notices in October 2017 requiring them to reduce stockpile sizes within a six-week period – these were not complied with.The situation did not improve at all, so the Environment Agency served Suspension Notices on the three companies in March 2018. This was to prohibit any further receipt of waste until the risk of pollution was reduced.District Judge Wheeler said the offences had been carried out over a significant period of time and were not far short of a flagrant disregard for the law.Iain Storer, Installations Lead for the Environment Agency in the West Midlands, said:“We welcome this sentence which should act as a deterrent to others considering flouting the law.“These sites posed a significant environmental threat due to the high risk of fire and potentially significant impact to local communities and amenities.“As a regulator, the Environment Agency will not hesitate to pursue companies that fail to meet its obligations to the environment.“The conditions of an environmental permit are designed to protect people and the environment.“Failure to comply with these legal requirements is a serious offence that can damage the environment, harm human health and undermine local legitimate waste companies.“If anyone is suspicious of waste activities they should call our 24/7 hotline on 0800 80 70 60 or Crimestoppers anonymously and in confidence on 0800 555 111.”Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 24 January 2023Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactWaste managementIs this page useful?

It triggers regenerative soil function in a way that improves soil structure.  It builds soil carbon through carbon sequestration, and increases water holding capacity and nutrient presence and availability - this improves fertility and increases plant growth.Other successes include:At 4 farms along the upper Stour, Lodden and Fern Brook new woodland areas have been created to intercept run-off, whilst also improving the habitat.In response to the October 2021 flooding in Motcombe a farmer in the Fern Brook installed 10 large woody debris dams to slow the flow and is this year creating 2.5 hectares of woodland.On the River Cale 0.5 kilometres of fencing has been installed, keeping cattle out of the watercourse, improving water quality and habitats.An event for farmers, helping them understand how agricultural run-off can affect watercourse.Farm visits to advise on slurry and manure management.Environment Agency £50,000 funding for 2022/23 will enable the Stour Headwaters project to continue.  Further farm visits and events are planned, and schemes with farmers to slow the flow upstream of Divelish, Bishops Caundle and Buckland Newton, communities that were affected by flooding in October 2021.To further reduce the risk of flooding in Motcombe, the project aims to extend the area of large woody debris and slow the flow in the Fern Brook, a tributary of the Lodden.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 29 November 2022        Related content      Adding a logo to a protected food or drink name: follow the rulesExplore the topicPollution and environmental qualityBiodiversity and ecosystemsIs this page useful?

Shipping documents described the waste as plastic, which can be exported to Indonesia for recycling.Howard McCann, prosecuting for the Environment Agency, told the court that between 27 June and 5 July 2019, Wang had caused his company to export some 382 tonnes of household waste in 22 sea containers from its site in Droitwich via the ports of Felixstowe and Southampton to Indonesia.Opening up one of the 22 containersIncluded in the waste were about 1,590 nappies or sanitary items, plus 1,338 electrical items and about 33,639 tins/cans.Other contaminants included numerous items of clothing, textiles and rags, unopened plastic bags, glass, wood, golf balls, toys, a used toilet brush and contaminated food and drink cartons.Mr McCann told the court that the defendant was the sole director of Berry Polymer Limited, a company which was dissolved on 24 August 2021, at the time of the offending.Wang had agreed to sell some 500 tonnes of plastic bottle waste to a broker at £270 per tonne. A purchase order confirmed the load site of the waste as “Berry Polymer Limited, 20 The Furlong Droitwich WR9 9AH.” Berry Polymer invoiced the broker £103,210.20 for 382.26 tonnes of “plastic bottles.”The offence was discovered by Environment Agency officers who conducted initial inspections of some of the 22 containers at the ports of Southampton (17 containers) and Felixstowe (5) on 4 July 2019.These inspections recorded significant evidence of contamination, flies and, in some containers, a rotting decomposing smell.The containers were deemed unfit for export at that stage and prevented from onward shipment to Indonesia.Five of the containers were transported to the Environment Agency’s inspection facility at Felixstowe for full examination, one of the bales examined was so bad that an officer was physically sick.Ultimately all the containers were returned to the site in Droitwich for reprocessing.When interviewed, Wang, who was abroad at the time, said the material supplied was not as described because his company’s usual bale inspection had either not happened or was sub-standard.In sentencing, District Judge Strongman said this was a “blunder” by Wang, which had cost him his business and his reputation.Sham Singh, senior investigating officer for the Environment Agency, said:This prosecution sends out a strong message that we will investigate and where necessary prosecute anyone found to be involved in illegally exporting waste.Waste crime can have a serious environmental impact and puts communities at risk. It undermines legitimate business and the investment and economic growth that goes with it.We support legitimate businesses and are proactively supporting them by disrupting and stopping the illegal waste exports.If anyone suspects that a company is doing something wrong, please contact the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60 or report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.The chargeThat Tianyong Wang, as the director of Berry Polymer Limited (company number 11887373 - dissolved), through your consent, connivance or neglect, and by virtue of Regulation 55(1) of the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007, between 27 June and 5 July 2019, you caused that company to commit the offence of transporting waste specified in Article 36(1)(b) of the European Waste Shipments Regulation 1013/2006, namely 22 containers of waste collected from households, that were destined for recovery in Indonesia, a country to which the OECD Decision does not apply, contrary to Regulation 23 of the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007.BackgroundThe export of waste collected from households to non-OECD (Organisation for Economic and Development) countries is prohibited by Article 36 of the Waste Shipment Regulations.The offence of transporting waste to a non-OECD country in breach of the prohibition is created by Regulation 23 and the directors’ offence by regulation 55(1) of the TFS Regulations 2007. The offence is one of strict liability.A shipment of waste starts at the point of loading in the country of dispatch and continues until the waste has been recovered at the facility in the country of destination. This is why the export is not regarded as an attempt, despite the containers being prevented from leaving Felixstowe and Southampton.For waste to be categorised as green list such as plastic waste, it must have been collected separately or been properly sorted.Properly sorted means that the sorting is sufficient to remove contaminants to the point where any contamination that remains is so small as to be minimal and does not prevent the waste from becoming green list waste.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 11 August 2022Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactWaste managementIs this page useful?

The Environment Agency’s new chair, Alan Lovell was also present.The new scheme has involved constructing flood storage areas, with flood walls and flood embankments, at West Lakes Academy, the Falcon Club, How Bank Farm and at Whangs Beck. Culvert, which are underground watercourses improvements also happened at Croadalla Avenue on Skirting Beck. Property resistance measures having also been delivered to 36 properties across the town. Property resistance measures are undertaken inside a property to reduce damage caused by floodwaters.As well as reducing flood risk, at least 600 trees have been planted as part of this scheme and 16.5 acres of habitat improvement works have been created in the area of Black Beck. This brings benefits to the local environment and the local community through improvements such as educational ponds for use by local school children.Sustainable Drainage Systems will also be delivered at various locations across Egremont by Cumbria County Council with Environment Agency funding. Sustainable Drainage Systems are a natural approach to managing drainage in and around propertiesPaul Robertshaw, Project Executive at the Environment Agency said:“We are delighted that the £18.5 million flood scheme is now complete, reducing the flood risk to 220 properties, ahead of winter this year.“The scheme not only better protects people and properties in the area from flooding but has created a better place for the community by providing, improved community amenities and an enhanced environment for wildlife to thrive.“The help and cooperation of local residents, West Lakes Academy, the Falcon Club, schools and nurseries has helped this scheme and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their support over the years.”MP Trudy Harrison said:“This is a milestone day for the Egremont community.

Guest countries included India, Indonesia and the UAE.The G7 members committed to the swift and effective implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) – which the UK played a key role in agreeing in Montreal last year - demonstrating their collective leadership in halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030. They also highlighted the need to mobilise funding from all sources to support developing countries to protect nature.The Environment Secretary called on her fellow ministers to deliver on their existing commitments to increase finance for nature to close the nature finance gap and scrap or repurpose environmentally harmful subsidies.G7 ministers committed to dedicate a significant amount of international climate finance to nature-based solutions, delivering benefits for climate, people and nature. Ministers called on Multilateral Development Banks (MBDs) and International Financial Institutions (IFIs) to do the same, and for businesses to progressively reduce negative, and increase positive, impacts on biodiversity.The commitments today showcase a step forward for nature and put an end to species extinction through increasing the mobilisation of resources, including private finance to fund the global effort to halt nature loss.Speaking after the meeting, Environment Secretary Thérèse Coffey said:The G7 have committed to the swift and effective implementation of the landmark Global Biodiversity Framework – which aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.Following this historic agreement reached at COP15 last year, I am delighted to have met my G7 counterparts today to discuss ways we can build on this as a global community and tackle the challenges we all face with meaningful and urgent action.We have seen tremendous progress this weekend and it has been great to see our countries working together to raise our ambition and lead by example, each playing our part.The group also committed to redouble efforts to increase action to end plastic pollution by 2040, halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, protect marine biodiversity in the high sea, and reduce pollution.The Communique is published online on the Japanese Ministry of the Environment website.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 16 April 2023    Last updated 17 April 2023      + show all updates17 April 2023Added link to the G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers’ Communique.16 April 2023First published.Explore the topicClimate change and energyMarinePollution and environmental qualityRural and countrysideIs this page useful?

Working together, the Environment Agency, HMRC, DVSA and police combine efforts and use their powers in a targeted way. This could include ensuring vehicles are safe and maintained to the correct standards, that waste being transported is described accurately and that the destination is the right facility.Gerry Magee from the Environment Agency’s Environmental Crime team said:The Environment Agency regularly works in partnership with other organisations to carry out operations to check that the relevant rules are being followed during the transportation of waste. The combined use of our powers helps us ensure that robust and proportionate action is taken where it is needed. We will continue to work with partners in this way to get the best outcomes for communities.DVSA’s Director of Enforcement, Marian Kitson said:DVSA’s priority is protecting everyone from unsafe drivers and vehicles. Alongside our partners, we are eager to contribute to this valuable work for the public’s safety in Staffordshire. All operators and drivers have a legal and moral duty to ensure their vehicles are safe and roadworthy. Failing to do so will result in us taking action where a danger to public safety is identified.Notes to editorsThis operation is focussed on commercial vehicles moving waste in the North Staffordshire areaAs part of the operation, commercial vehicles were checked on the A5271 at Porthill roundabout and on Cemetery Road in SilverdaleShare this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 16 March 2022        Related content      Skills Minister delivers keynote speech at International Higher Education ForumNatural England licence: aerial photography and height data (APGB consortium)Natural England licence: marine and coastal dataNatural England licence: Land Cover Map vector dataNatural England licence: marine and hydrologyExplore the topicWaste managementIs this page useful?

Sellafield alone has thousands of items that must be cut up and removed before the buildings can be decommissioned.ChallengeAccurate cutting up and removal of radioactive vessels and pipes from areas that are contaminated or difficult to access.SolutionRemotely deployed and innovative snake-arm robot with purpose-designed lightweight cutting head, for laser powers up to 10kW:  LaserSnake2BenefitsCheaper, faster and safer than conventional cutting techniques, producing less secondary waste.DetailDecommissioning often requires the development of bespoke tools for remote deployment, or for workers in protective air-fed suits to use hand-held tools. Such approaches can be hazardous for the operators (radiologically and conventionally), extremely time-consuming and hence costly.Laser cutting is faster and far more efficient than conventional cutting techniques and is a well-established process used in aerospace, automotive and defence industries. It is also safer, cheaper and produces lesssecondary waste. One approach to laser cutting in a remote environment is LaserSnake2, an accurate snake-arm robot with a long reach arm, carrying a decommissioning-specific lightweight laser cutting head with the capability to cut metal up to 100mm thick.The snake-arm robot is highly dexterous, able to access areas where other robotic technologies would have difficulties. LaserSnake2, now ready for commercial deployment, can be customised to suit a range of conditions, bringing benefits for decommissioning that is usually carried out both remotely and manually.Sellafield Ltd, as part of its Active Demonstrator Programme, has now completed a cutting demonstration using LaserSnake2 in the radioactive environment of the First Generation Reprocessing Plant. The deployment was the first of its kind on a UK nuclear site, and a significant achievement.A 5 tonne, double-walled stainless steel vessel, with a 32mm thick inner shell, was entirely and successfully size reduced. This trial has shown LaserSnake2’s capability to remotely cut some of the thickest materials on the Sellafield site, and its potential to access challenging radioactive areas. Other NDA sites could benefit from the LaserSnake2 approach.A high level of collaboration between project partners, and end-users in particular, has accelerated the demonstration on site and provided valuable insight in how to introduce innovative technologies from other industries.Viewing remotely, some of the development team watch LaserSnake2 in actionR&D approachThe development of LaserSnake2 and application of the associated technologies illustrates the routes for encouraging innovation and technology developments:early innovation funding from NDA’s R&D portfolio to demonstrate the effectiveness of lasers in cutting metal and removing contaminated concrete surfaceseffective leveraging of funding from government-led initiatives to enable the combination of a cutting head with a snake-arm robot and demonstrate its potential as a decommissioning tool in a non-radioactive environmentleveraging of NDA funding from a collaborative innovation competition with Innovate UK and BEIS to develop LaserSnake2, a new, larger, more accurate snake-arm robot, with an improved laser cutting head.

The water company has also been ordered to pay prosecution costs of £58, 365. The court heard how the company failed to respond to alarms warning of a blockage, failed to adequately manage sewage sludge, and failed to adequately manage a situation when a piece of equipment failed. Resulting in sewage being discharged into a number of watercourses in Worcestershire.Prosecuting for the Environment Agency, Counsel Mr James Puzey told the court that in February 2018, Severn Trent Water failed to respond promptly to alarms at its sewage treatment works at Blackminster, near Evesham.  A blockage to the works resulted in approximately 360,000 litres of sewage being illegally discharged to the nearby Broadway Brook.  It was hours before Severn Trent Water operatives attended to take remedial action. The court also heard how over the winter of 2017/2018, Severn Trent Water failed to adequately manage treatment of sewage sludge at other treatment works in Worcestershire.This caused sludge to build up within the sewage treatment system. At the company’s sewage treatment works at Bromsgrove and Stoke Prior, problems with the sewage treatment process led to discharges into the Sugar Brook and Hen Brook exceeding the permitted levels of BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) in early March 2018.Severn Trent Water also had problems at its Priest Bridge works near Redditch in July and August 2018, when a piece of equipment designed to remove fibrous material from incoming sewage at the start of the process failed. The company did not adequately manage the situation, which resulted in discharges from the site in breach of limits set for ammoniacal nitrogen over a 2-day period in early August 2018.  A similar incident had occurred in 2011. In passing sentence, District Judge Strongman said in respect of the Blackminster incident, “Alarms were not actioned as they should have been.” This resulted in the works “discharging for 4 hours.”In respect of the Bromsgrove and Stoke Prior incident the judge stated, “Bad weather played a part but more should have been done to cope with the problems by way of spare capacity.”In respect of the Priest Bridge incident, District Judge Strongman said, “There was a serious problem developing”, and that Severn Trent Water were, “in no great hurry to carry out maintenance.” Severn Trent Water’s previous convictions were an aggravating feature of this prosecution.A fine of £1 million was imposed for the offence at Blackminster and £500,000 for the offence at Priest Bridge.  No separate penalty was imposed for breaches at Bromsgrove and Stoke Prior. Since these incidents the company has advised the Environment Agency that it has changed its management structure and provided better technical support.The company has also invested at the Bromsgrove works to improve treatment efficiency. Severn Trent Water Ltd have also stated that it plans to rebuild its works at Blackminster, and to close the works at Stoke Prior towards the end of the decade.David Throup, Environment Manager for the West Midlands Area of the Environment Agency, said:Incidents like this are preventable and are completely unacceptable, particularly at a time when the need to protect the water environment for wildlife and people has never been greater and when public consciousness on environmental matters is so high.Water companies are aware that their activities have the potential for serious environmental impacts, and they know that we will take action when they cause pollution. The Environment Agency does and will continue to hold water companies to account when their performance falls below acceptable standards.We’d urge anyone that sees suspected water pollution to report it to us immediately on our incident hotline 0800 80 70 60.This conviction follows the announcement that the Environment Agency and Ofwat have both launched new investigations into sewage treatment works after new checks led to water companies admitting that they could be releasing unpermitted sewage discharges. Any company caught breaching their permits could face a range of possible enforcement action – up to and including prosecution.Sentencing of the case brought by the Environment Agency, occurred at Kidderminster Magistrates’ Court on 7 December 2021. The company pleaded guilty to allegations at an earlier court hearing in August 2021.Notes to editorsCharges/breaches of permitSevern Trent Water Limited (company number 02366686), on 20 February 2018 at Blackminster Wastewater Treatment Works, Blackminster, Worcestershire, failed to comply with condition 2.3.2 of Environmental Permit number S/16/26290/R, in that sewage was discharged into the Broadway Brook at Blackminster, Worcestershire, in conditions other than those set out in table S3.3 of the Environmental Permit, contrary to Regulation 38 (2) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.Between 3 March 2018 and 10 March 2018, at Bromsgrove Sewage Treatment Works Aston Road, Bromsgrove Severn Trent Water Limited did breach a condition of Environmental Permit S/07/56027/R in respect of upper tier limits set for Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in the final effluent discharging to Sugar Brook contrary to regulation 38(2) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.Between 5 March 2018 and 10 March 2018, at Stoke Prior Sewage Treatment Works, Stoke Prior, Bromsgrove Severn Trent Water Limited did breach a condition of Environmental Permit S/07/56078 in respect of upper tier limits set for Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in the final effluent discharging to Hen Brook contrary to regulation 38(2) Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016.Between 6 August 2018 and 9 August 2018 at Priest Bridge Sewage Treatment Works, Priest Bridge, Worcestershire, Severn Trent Water Limited did breach  Environmental Permit S/19/26264/R Condition 3.1.1 relating to limits set for ammoniacal nitrogen contrary to Regulation 38(2) of the Environmental permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2016.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 8 December 2021Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityWater qualityIs this page useful?

But the reminder comes after agency officers found a large amount of buried asbestos waste when executing a search warrant at a site in the South West. The operator of the site was arrested by the police and questioned.Asbestos and other hazardous wastes require disposal by specialist contractors at sites that can legally and safely handle it. Mishandling it creates a serious risk to public health, the environment and wildlife.Kevin Baker of the Environment Agency said:Tradespeople that create waste, especially during activities like construction and roofing, must make sure that waste goes to a site legally able to accept it. Roofing tiles often contain asbestos so make sure you know what you’re dealing with.When waste is transferred between different parties it needs a waste transfer note. If a site or waste operator asks for cash for tipping, and provides zero paperwork to you, then be suspicious. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.If you get rid of asbestos or other waste at illegal sites, don’t be surprised if you get a knock on the door.Unscrupulous people posing as genuine waste collectors cause serious harm to the environment by taking construction waste and dumping it. This waste causes air, ground and water pollution and odour issues. Criminal actions like this also undermine legitimate waste collection businesses.Managers, owners, and staff of all construction businesses must use a registered waste carrier to collect, recycle or dispose of their waste. Check the Environment Agency public register of waste carriers before using them. Make sure the waste is accurately described and know where your waste is going. Follow the EA blog for all the steps builders can take to follow their duty of care.Anyone who suspects illegal waste activity can report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 11 May 2022Explore the topicWaste managementIs this page useful?

She said:Everyone has a part to play in protecting and improving our great bathing waters. If we continue to work together to reduce pollution, we can improve water quality and ensure our bathing waters and coastal communities continue to thrive.To check bathing water quality and for further information about what affects it, go to www.gov.uk/quality-of-local-bathing-waterShare this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 30 August 2019Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityIs this page useful?

Working remotely, we have received all of the necessary paperwork and photographs from Tom White Waste and carried out a meeting with them on Zoom, which included a site tour via their real time CCTV, to check their sites comply with the regulations of their permits. In this case we were satisfied the company has shown good practice and complied with the regulations.Coronavirus is not an excuse to operate illegally. We are continuing to work closely with businesses and industry to help them meet their legal requirements and we are continuing to enforce regulatory requirements, while following the government’s guidance on social distancing.We make clear in our approach to regulation and enforcement that we expect operators to take all reasonable steps to comply with regulatory requirements using contingency plans to help them comply.Businesses and householders should carry out checks to ensure that they are using legitimate companies to deal with their waste. To check if a waste carrier is genuine visit the Environment Agency’s public register.Anyone who suspects a company is operating illegally can call the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60 or report it anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.Notes to editorsThe Environment Agency’s regulatory approach to regulation and enforcement during the coronavirus outbreakTo support business to meet the challenge of operating during the pandemic, the Environment Agency has put in place a number of regulatory position statements, which help businesses minimise risks to the environment and human health where, for reasons beyond their control, compliance with certain regulatory requirements may not be possible due to coronavirus.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 28 May 2020        Related content      HMT exceptions to cross-government moratoria on spending: Quarter 2 2010CH2 4LB, MWH Treatment Limited: environmental permit issuedExplore the topicCoronavirus (COVID-19)Waste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

Here, £1,500 had paid for a local farmer to bring their livestock to temporarily graze over the autumn and then cut the hay for us in the summer.The remaining £19,247 is planned to be spent on purchase of land at Common Hill, near Fownhope. This land is adjacent to another of our reserves which will extend the site and restore limestone grassland for wildlife.Notes for editorsEnforcement Undertakings (EUs) enable firms and individuals who have damaged the environment or operated outside of legislative requirements to offer to complete actions which will address the cause and effect of their offending, including making a payment to an appropriate environmental project.EUs can be offered for offences including polluting rivers, breaching permit conditions designed to protect communities, or failing to register and comply with recycling/recovery obligations. The Environment Agency then carefully considers whether the actions offered by the offender are acceptable.Where the breach does not have a direct impact on the environment, such as Packaging Waste Regulations offences, EU offers must contain actions that will protect, restore or enhance the environment.Environmental incidents should be reported to the Environment Agency’s 24 hour incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 25 June 2020Explore the topicEnvironmental permitsParks, trails and nature reservesIs this page useful?

This unique collaboration between the artist, the Environment Agency and community will enable social engagement, allowing participants to feel some ownership of the final design – a plastic sculpture of a body weighing 98.66 kilograms.In the UK we produce 98.66 kilograms of plastic waste per capita annually. The unbelievable truth is we are throwing away significantly more plastic than our own weight as an entire population, every single year.Joshua Sofaer says of the project’s conception and his involvement in the show:In 2019 I had the opportunity to shadow members of the Environment Agency Regulated Industry team as they conducted their checks on industrial sites, including one of the largest plastic recyclers in the UK and a giant pork pie factory. I also visited small ‘end of life’ workshops that depollute cars, materials recycling facilities, and illegal waste sites.It was an eye-opening experience. Then the pandemic struck, and the world changed. But one thing that hasn’t changed, and in fact is getting worse, is the amount of waste that we produce.Single use PPE, which is saving lives, has only made this problem greater. This exhibition wants to raise some questions about the work of the Regulated Industry team and the scale of the plastic waste problem in the UK, including the waste produced by the creation and exhibition of art.I’m delighted to be working with BACKLIT and the Environment Agency on this project and looking forward to engaging with people across Nottingham.‘Regulated Exhibition’ will see BACKLIT Gallery transformed into a ‘factory’ where the public can drop off plastics in the depot which will be accepted and sorted by Science Communicators.The Sustainable Business Team’s ‘Sustainability & Innovation Fund’ has contributed towards the ‘Regulated Exhibition.’Throughout the exhibition, the Environment Agency will periodically regulate the processes undertaken and provide an insight into their work. There will be a film following the day in the life of a Regulated Industry officer at the Environment Agency and how they regulate and manage waste.Mark Haslam, Environment Manager for the Environment Agency said:We have partnered with the BACKLIT Gallery in Nottingham and artist Joshua Sofaer to produce ‘Regulated Exhibition – a plastic human’ as part of our community engagement. Much of the plastic waste produced by individuals in the country ends up being sorted, processed, and disposed of at sites regulated by the Environment Agency.The focus of the exhibition is to engage local communities to consider plastic usage through a sustainability lens. It also provides an ideal opportunity to raise awareness around the role the Environment Agency plays in protecting the environment through its regulation.This is the first time we have worked with the arts sector in the East Midlands to highlight environmental issues and show how the Environment Agency regulates and manages waste. We’re sure the exhibition will be highly successful in increasing awareness of how we all need to reduce, reuse, and recycle more of our waste and resources.The plastics collected from the public will be used to create a mould and human sculpture of a person representing the annual waste, which will then become part of the final show. The live ‘body cast’ will be carried out 30 October by Richard Arm, Senior Research Fellow at Nottingham Trent University and leader of the Flexural Composites Research Laboratory for the Advanced Textiles Research Group in the School of Art and Design.We need your help:BACKLIT is making a call out to a member of the public who is 98 kilograms (15.4 stone) to volunteer for the live ‘body cast’ for the mould for the final piece. They will need to be available 30 October and public will be invited to watch the process. Moulding the cast of the plastic person will take place 20 November which will then be displayed as part of the exhibition.Please help us find a suitable person and support us collecting plastic. All types of plastics will be accepted but they must be washed and cleaned.Other events will run throughout the exhibition, some by BACKLIT Studio Artists, including panel discussions with scientists, artists, and regulators about the hidden environmental impact of art making. There will be film about the artists’ work, community and family workshops. This is a great opportunity to collaborate with organisations outside of the arts sector, highlighting environmental issues and promoting responsibility.Matthew Chesney, BACKLIT Director and Curator, says of the exhibition:BACKLIT is delighted to work with the Environment Agency to explore very important conversations around waste produced by the gallery and the environment. We are thrilled to work with one of UKs most exciting artists, Joshua Sofaer, whose previous projects have engaged and ignited the public to come together and be accountable for the artwork. This is a chance to use art to enable people to take part and have crucial conversations on how they can make their environment a safer and more enjoyable place.EventsCommunity coffee morningFriday 8 October, 11am -1pm at BACKLIT, no booking required, free.Friday 12 November, 11am -1pm at BACKLIT, no booking required, free.Donate plastics for recycling.Walk and talk27 November, 1pm – 3pm; behind the scenes insight into the making of the exhibition with artist Joshua Sofaer and Matthew Chesney (BACKLIT Director).

This includes a range of criteria such as pollution levels, pest control and sampling procedures. This covers the measurement of how much product at a site is recyclable. Monitoring how much of this is recycled by each facility is done on a commercial level at each site.Between 2000/2001 and 2019, the amount of waste going to landfill decreased by 43%.The government’s landmark Environment Bill and Resources and Waste Strategy set out how we will go further and faster, to reduce, reuse, and recycle, and help leave the environment in a better state than we found it for future generations. These include plans to place greater responsibility on producers to make their items more resource efficient and easier to reuse and recycle.Businesses and householders should carry out checks to ensure that they are using legitimate companies to deal with their waste. To check if a waste carrier is genuine visit the Environment Agency’s public register.The project supports the Environment Agency’s ambition to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste, helping to achieve the goals and commitments outlined in its EA2025 five-year plan to create a better place for people, wildlife and the environment, and the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan.Follow us on: Twitter Facebook YouTube InstagramAbout BACKLIT GalleryBACKLIT www.backlit.org.uk, Alfred House, Ashley Street, Sneinton NG3 1JG is a 3-storey independent art gallery.

The plant poses a big risk to the environment as it outcompetes native plant species for nutrients, light and space, often becoming dominant. It can also enter the river channel and block flow and in-river structures, which increases the risk of flooding.A team of staff volunteered to give up their time to do the work and made a significant difference.A spokesperson from the Environment Agency said:It was a very successful 2 days. We removed the Balsam that had re-grown at a site which was cleared 2 years ago. We also cleared patches in or directly adjacent to the river, limiting the chance of seeds entering the watercourse and spreading the plant.It became apparent that Himalayan Balsam is more prevalent in the area than first thought, however by targeting specific sites posing most risk, we can help limit its spread.As we hand-pulled the plant, taking the roots with it, and left it in piles, it shouldn’t re-grow; however we will be making checks in the next few months.If members of the public come across the plant they should only attempt to remove it if it hasn’t set seed - touching it once it has set seed will cause the seeds to disperse up to 7 metres away.The best method of removal is to pull it up and place it in a pile away from any watercourse, preferably with a plastic sheet underneath to ensure the roots are not able to re-grow.Members of the public can report sightings of the plant on i-Record.Seeds can be spread on clothing, equipment and animals. By following the Check, Clean, Dry procedure the spreading of invasive species can be prevented.Further information on Himalayan Balsam and other invasive non-native species can be found on the Non-native Species Secretariat website.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 20 August 2019        Related content      Presenting the draft Security Council 2018 annual reportCalling for full respect of international law and dialogue in the Middle EastTransitioning security responsibilities and preparing for equal elections in SomaliaPublic attitudes to trade tracker (PATT): wave 1UK - Republic of Korea joint statement: shared values, ever growing partnershipExplore the topicWildlife and habitat conservationIs this page useful?

The species has been in decline since non-native American signal crayfish escaped into UK waters in the 1970s.This relocation is the second such rescue in the county after a similar effort in 2017 saw hundreds of crayfish successfully transferred to chalk streams in the Lincolnshire Wolds. Surveys carried out in the area since have confirmed the crayfish are breeding and boosting the population.The crayfish will be examined by EA officers before being moved to their new locationRichard Chadd, senior environmental monitoring officer with the Environment Agency, said:Lincolnshire’s flat, open rivers and pristine chalk streams are a haven for native crayfish, making our county one of the largest strongholds in England for this protected species.They’re a vital part of the local ecology, which is why we’re working so hard to protect them – and these efforts are just part of our ongoing work to improve the environment for people and nature.White-clawed crayfish, named for the pale colour of the underside of their claws, are the country’s largest native freshwater crustaceans. Generally growing to 30 – 40mm in length, some can live up to 12 years and reach 120mm long from tip to tail.The Ark project is just one example of the work being done as part of the government’s 25 year environment plan to protect and improve the environment within this generation.Collectively, non-native invasive species cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year.Everyone can do their part to prevent the spread of invasive species and protect native ones by taking care to follow the biosecurity steps of thoroughly checking, cleaning and drying your clothes and equipment any time you’ve been in the water.

The series of work has included many different soft engineering techniques at different locations throughout Cumbria including river restoration, tree planting and habitat creation.Environment Agencies Mike Farrell said“This has been a great programme to work on over the last 10 years, it’s good to see that all our hard work has paid off. Having successfully completed 130 projects, working with 219 different partner organisations, the programme has led to significant environmental improvements across Cumbria.I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in this project over the years, from our partners to local school children, local angling groups to the passing public and schools further afield. It really is amazing what can be done when we all come together. Looking back and seeing work we implemented 10 years ago thriving and working to its best potential is certainly rewarding and makes all the hard work from everyone involved totally worth it!’’Over the last ten years, the Environment Agency, as part of the works, have coordinated the planting of 31,995 trees across the county. This provides river bank stabilisation, creates shaded areas to help boost fish populations and slow the flow of the rivers. All completed with the help of hundreds of school pupils, local angling clubs, associations and environmentalists adding up to thousands of volunteer hours.The programme has introduced of over 2072 meters of willow to protect banks from erosion as well as 44,141 meters of fencing along water courses. This helps to create riparian strips (area where land meets water) and wildlife corridors. It also allows natural rejuvenation of the river banks, contributes to natural flood management due to re-profiling of the river banks and also decreases the amount of sediment that goes into the river. Along with this the introduction of 58 sections of woody material debris and management of gravel beds provide shelter for young fish and creates channel diversity, enhancing fish to naturally breed leading to a higher number of fish in our rivers.Dale Renac, Chairman of the River Ellen Angling Association (REAA) said‘We send our thanks from the REAA to the Environment Agency for their funding and help when carrying out projects on the river Ellen. Six years ago the Bullgill project was started and has now created an excellent riparian strip with over 500 trees planted, the biggest part of it being willow which helped reduce erosion of the river banks.To this present day were seeing a big increase in damsel fly’s and dragon fly in the improved and replaced river banks. Juvenile fish can be seen amongst the new vegetation that has grown near the river banks and otters and kingfisher are regularly sighted in the area. It is so good to see what can be achieved from these projects when we all come together to help the environment’The Environment Agency has also worked with hundreds of school children from 15 different schools, across Cumbria, Nottingham and Sunderland. Students from Sunderland attend with Derwent Hill outdoor education centre in Cumbria.Matthew Ellis, director for the centre said:“The Environment Agency, through our relationship with Mike Farrell, have been instrumental in these courses providing expert guidance, advice on sensitive and vulnerable locations and up to date information about the current ecological challenges.In the last three years we are very proud to have planted over two thousand trees and engaged in real projects such as shoring up river banks after devastating floods thanks to this ongoing support.”A spokesperson for the Oak Field Special Needs school said:“Oak Field School is a school for children with severe learning difficulties aged 3 to 19 years. For over 10 years, sixth form students and old students have had the great opportunity to work with Mike Farrell and the Environment Agency team.The students have planted trees and cleared Himalayan Balsam, it has been an amazing and successful project to be involved in over the years, giving the young people the confidence and the experience of working together to put something back into the environment.The students learnt a lot about the need to care for the countryside and the impact that conservation has on the local environment. Many of the students return every year and look forward to meeting Mike and the friendly and helpful Environment Agency team.The school and students appreciate the fantastic opportunity to partake in conservation of rivers and nature, we hope to return next year to spend some more quality time caring for our environment in the beautiful location of the Lake District.”The project has been rewarding for all involved and it is clear that by working together great things can be achieved.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 28 May 2020        Related content      Rod fishing byelaws: AngliaRod fishing byelaws: South EastRod fishing byelaws: North EastRiver Thames: lock and weir fishing permit application formRod fishing byelaws: MidlandsExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Second homes in the area will also not have had their oil tanks used or inspected recently due to lockdown travel restrictions. But cold weather can weaken joints and damage underground pipes.Senior Environment Officer Brian Grant said:Oil pollution is one of the most common problems recorded by the Environment Agency and across Devon and Cornwall it is on the increase.Not only can heating oil affect our aquifers it can also have major impact in our rivers and streams and harm fish, birds and aquatic life. Not only is the cost of losing the oil expensive, clean-up costs can be large and often not covered by household insurance.Leaked oil can end up in drains, many of which lead directly to rivers, streams, lakes and even garden ponds, having the same effect as pouring it directly into the watercourse. It can also pose a risk to aquifers. In East Devon one aquifer supplies water to about 250,000 people.Oil is poisonous to fish and other wildlife and smothers plants – just 2 litres of oil could seriously pollute the volume of fresh water needed to fill an olympic-sized swimming pool.Householders with domestic oil tanks should take the following action to ensure they are safe for use:Position tanks as far away as possible from drains, streams and ponds.Inspect tanks, pipes and other equipment for leaks, damage and interference once a week. Any problems should be fixed as soon as possible by an Oil Firing Technical Association (OFTEC) technician.Arrange for the boiler and tank to be serviced at least once a year by an OFTEC technician. This should include any underground pipe work.Monitor how much oil you use. If the volume of oil being used suddenly increases, there could be a leak.Supervise oil deliveries. Never allow your tank to be overfilled and don’t order more oil than you can safely store.Check your home insurance covers clean-up costs on both your property and neighbouring land. Always notify insurers immediately in the event of a spill or suspected spill.If a tank starts leaking, you should try to stop the oil soaking into the ground or going down drains. Contact your insurance company to arrange for an OFTEC technician or UKSpill accredited clean-up company to attend.Secondary containment, such as a bund, will prevent oil from escaping into the environment if a leak occurs. This is a legal requirement for domestic tanks which store more than 3,500 litres.To report an oil spill or leak, contact the Environment Agency’s 24-hour emergency hotline on 0800 80 70 60.

There is also an engaging quiz and opportunity to share opinions on plastic pollution.Environment Agency plastics and sustainability team project lead Lucy Smith said:Every year more than 12 million tonnes of plastic enters the world’s ocean from land, rivers and marine activities. And around 967 kilograms of plastic waste has been removed from Plymouth in recent months according to our partner database, thanks to community-led litter pickers.With the help of these interactive posters, we hope to clampdown on poor waste disposal habits by encouraging people to think how the health of our planet is shaped by our actions.It can be really confusing knowing what type of waste goes where. We hope this project will engage people in a fun way and help break down complicated issues into straightforward action. Every individual can play a part in ocean health, and every positive action counts.The initiative is one of many projects being funded by the 3 year cross channel Interreg Preventing Plastic Pollution project - a partnership of 18 organisations, including Plymouth City Council, Westcountry Rivers Trust and the University of Plymouth - which aims to identify and target plastic hotspots, embed behaviour change in local communities and businesses, and implement effective solutions and alternatives.The posters plug into behaviour change ambitions by encouraging people to properly dispose of their waste and step up daily avoidable plastic habits by following the waste hierarchy - avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle. The posters will be in place for 12 months, after which the interactions will be evaluated to help inform future initiatives to prevent plastic pollution.The project builds on Environment Agency goals and commitments outlined in its 5 year plan to create better places for people, wildlife and the environment.As a regulator, the Environment Agency prevents waste plastic entering the environment by cracking down on waste crime and poor waste management. As an influencer, its ambition is to promote better environmental practices that result in a reduction of plastic waste.BackgroundInterreg Preventing Plastic Pollution (PPP):PPP is a €14million funded EU INTERREG VA France (Channel) England Programme project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund which works mainly across pilot catchments: Brest Harbour, Bay of Douarnenez, Bay of Veys, Test and Itchen, East Hampshire, Poole Harbour,  Medway, Tamar, and the Great Ouse catchments.PPP seeks to understand and reduce the impacts of plastic pollution in the river and marine environments by looking at the catchments from source to sea.Partners are the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Queen Mary University of London, LABOCEA Conseil, Expertise et Analyses, Syndicat mixte établissement public de gestion et d’aménagement de la baie de Douarnenez, Office Français De La Biodiversité, Parc naturel marin d’Iroise, Brest Métropole, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Counseil départemental de la Manche, Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer, The Rivers Trust, Syndicat de bassin de l’Elorn, ACTIMAR, Brest’aim, Westcountry Rivers Trust, South East Rivers Trust, and Plymouth City Council.Hello  Lamp PostThe Environment Agency worked with Hello Lamp Post which aims to educate the public through interactive, eye catching signage. By inviting citizens to interact with the things that they use every day and the things that make up the world around them (for example: lamp posts, parking meters, bus stops, statues and shop fronts), Hello Lamp Post is encouraging the general public to better understand an area or space and give real-time feedback.Through text-based mobile phone chats Hello Lamp Post empower communities to influence the future of their local area, in the vision of those who use the area most. Hello Lamp Post aims to help towns, cities and organisations use technology in a mindful, responsible way and help empower the communities they serve.PlymouthPlymouth is often called the ‘Ocean City’ due to its commitment to ocean health, its flourishing natural environment and world renowned marine research. The project builds on the city-wide plastic free partnership work to instil behaviour change in communities to cut off the flow of plastics into our seas.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 2 March 2023Explore the topicPollution and environmental qualityWaste and environmental impactWaste managementIs this page useful?

In Leicestershire, 3,700 fish – including 1,500 chub, 700 dace, 1,000 roach and 500 bream - reared at the Environment Agency’s National Coarse Fish Farm in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, will be released in the River Sence and River Soar as part of the annual programme.Every year, Calverton Fish Farm breeds coarse fish for release into rivers and still waters across England to help boost fish populations. The restocking in Leicestershire will provide a welcome boost to the angler experience in the area.Responsible fishing provides a good opportunity to connect with nature and feel the range of benefits doing so can bring. However, it is important to remember that a valid rod fishing licence is required, and anglers must adhere to fishing byelaws and fishery rules.Jake Dorey, Fisheries Technical Officer for the Environment Agency, said:While there is a healthy amount of fish in Leicestershire’s waterways, occasionally a helping hand is needed to restore the natural balance following a pollution incident or decline, or to create new fisheries and opportunities for anglers.The work of our National Fish Farm is funded by income from licence fees, so in the lead up to Christmas it’s great to see the fish farm continuing to produce strong and healthy fish needed for restocking and recovery.The restocking is part of an annual programme funded by income from rod licence sales. Restocking occurs in winter because water temperatures are low and this minimises any stress on the fish, giving them the best possible survival rates.Christmas is a good time to introduce the fish into rivers, as it enables them to acclimatise to their new surroundings, ahead of their spawning season in the spring. Fish also play a critical role in sustaining a river’s finely-balanced eco-system, so the wider natural environment will also get a festive boost.You need a rod fishing licence to fish for salmon, trout, freshwater fish, smelt or eel with a rod and line in England. Get yours from https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences.Notes to editorsIncome from rod fishing licence sales is used to fund our work to protect and improve fish stocks and fisheries. This includes improving habitats for fish, reinvesting money back to facilities and clubs for anglers, tackling illegal fishing and working with partners to encourage more people to give fishing a go.The Environment Agency’s National Coarse Fish Farm at Calverton remains our principal supply of coarse fish for restocking.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 12 December 2022Explore the topicFisheries fundingIs this page useful?

Fieldwork will include a topographic survey of the 7 sites associated with fish entrapment, drawn up as long sections, cross sections and plan views.There will be a round of stakeholder engagement and people will be able to view outline designs for each site. The findings and designs will be promoted in spring next year.Luke Kozak, Environment Agency Project Manager, said:This project will focus on the lower stretch of the River Tarrant.  Here it dries out frequently in summer, leading to significant numbers of fish and invertebrates becoming trapped in pools as the river recedes.We have been carrying out fish rescues for the past 20+ years to prevent the death of significant numbers of fish. Our data suggests that in 2003 some 2,800 salmonids were rescued from different areas of the River Tarrant and moved downstream to the main River Stour.The river is not only an important spawning tributary for salmonids, but also contains bullhead (Cottus gobio), a protected species under Annex II of the European Habitats Directive.BackgroundA network of restoration projects, new funding and updated definitions for chalk streams have all been outlined in a new plan published today (25 November) by Catchment Based Approach (CaBA).

Think before you drill  With the number of boreholes being drilled in the Westcountry without permission, abstractors are reminded to contact the Environment Agency for advice.From:Environment AgencyPublished3 September 2019        Potential abstractors should contact the Environment Agency to check about compliance first      With river levels and groundwater falling, landowners and businesses with boreholes, wells and springs are being urged to take a few simple steps to make sure they aren’t taking too much water.One of the first things people should do is check their abstraction licence. Restrictions can come into force after periods of dry weather so it is important licence holders know when to stop or reduce the amount of water they abstract. They also need to be aware of any specific conditions that apply.If you expand your business and require more water or if you want to start abstracting more than 20 cubic metres a day, don’t forget to check whether sufficient water is available in your area.The Environment  Agency uses Abstraction Licensing Strategies to help plan the management of water resources. They show where water may be available in various river catchments. People are urged to check first before they apply for a licence. Further details can be found at GOV.UK.Caz Lane, senior environment officer (Water Resources), at the Environment Agency said:It is essential licence conditions are complied with to help protect the environment.Failure to do so is an offence and can result in enforcement action.We are undertaking spot checks to ensure licence holders remain compliant.Illegal abstraction is on the increase in some parts of the Westcountry where boreholes are drilled without the appropriate permission. Prospective abstractors should first contact the Environment Agency that can advise landowners and businesses on how to stay compliant with UK legislation.Abstractors and their contractors are responsible for ensuring boreholes or wells are designed, constructed, tested, operated and decommissioned without polluting groundwater or impacting the surrounding surface water environment. So ‘Think before you Drill!’Note to editors:Anyone intending to abstract more than 20 cubic metres per day from a groundwater source needs an abstraction licence. They are also likely to need a groundwater investigation consent (GIC) under section 32 of the Water Resources Act and need to notify the British Geological Survey (BGS) if they intend to drill deeper than 15 metres.1 cubic metre of water is 219.9 gallons or 1000 litres.If you have any queries please contact the Environment Agency on 03708 506506Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 3 September 2019Explore the topicAbstract (take) waterIs this page useful?

It is thought the illegal dumping happened on or near 20 November 2020.Fly-tipping is not a victimless crime. The cost of clearing up falls on the landowner. But in limited circumstances the Environment Agency can step in. The asbestos is now being removed and disposed of safely.Dave Brogden of the Environment Agency said:The burden of investigating and clearing waste from fly-tipping often falls on local councils and we get involved if the amount and type of waste is so bad it can only be classified as illegal dumping.On this occasion we have stepped in to sort out this problem, the result of someone showing a complete disregard to the safety of the public and the environment and for the time and resources of local services such as ours, which are already under extreme pressure.Everyone who produces waste has a duty of care to make sure it does not cause harm to human health or pollute the environment and that it goes to the right place for disposal. On this occasion there were at least three sites within a few miles of the location permitted to accept this sort of hazardous waste.If the cost of any work being carried out is unusually low, the contractor may not have a permit to carry waste nor any intention of paying for its proper disposal. You can check their waste-carrying credentials at https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers.Dave Brogden said:If you use someone to take away waste, we want you to take 3 steps: check if they if they have a permit, ask where the rubbish will end up, then record the details of the vehicle used to take the rubbish away. Never pay cash and insist upon a receipt.If you have any information about who is responsible for this waste crime, contact the Environment Agency’s 24/7 hotline 0800 807060 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or www.crimestoppers-uk.org.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 8 December 2020Explore the topicWaste and environmental impactIs this page useful?

We aim to have the bulk of the work in place before the winter. We’re keeping a close eye on the construction programme and the need to consider temporary measures as a contingency plan.We then expect to continue work in stages throughout 2023 so we can make the structure look more aesthetically pleasing and in-keeping with the local character and heritage of Matlock.We apologise in advance for any disruption caused by these works and we’re grateful for the patience and support of the local community.Derbyshire County Council’s Cabinet Member for Highways Assets and Transport, Councillor Kewal Athwal Singh, said:I’m pleased to see that the Environment Agency has found the money to fix this important part of the flood defences for Matlock.We realise that the work will mean some disruption to traffic in the town, but this work needs doing as soon as possible to protect homes and businesses.A spokesperson for Derbyshire Dales District Council said:Derbyshire Dales District Council is pleased to be able to work with our partners at the Environment Agency and Derbyshire County Council on this important project.Sarah Dines, Member of Parliament for Derbyshire Dales said:I am absolutely delighted to hear that the Environment Agency will be reinstating the River Derwent flood defences. Resolving flooding issues in Derbyshire Dales has been at the top of my list of priorities since my election 2019.’Further information*Members of the public are invited to attend a drop in event to find out about the essential flood defence enabling works which is being held on Thursday 19 May from 2:30pm to 5:30pm at the Imperial Rooms, Imperial Road, Matlock, DE4 3NL.This is an opportunity for members of the public to speak with the project team and learn more about the next phase of works, particularly the likely impact on traffic movement and highways.The initial cost estimates are between £3.5 milliion to £5 million due to access being severely restricted which is likely to necessitate a large crane to lift plant and materials into place. These initial cost estimates will be refined as the design process takes shape and more detailed plans are developed.Following the collapse of a privately owned wall in February this year, the Environment Agency instructed Jackson Civil Engineering to complete an immediate repair by placing over 50 rock-filled bags in the River Derwent using a large crane situated on the A6. These emergency works were completed within 24 hours of the wall collapsing due to a forecast of further high-water levels on the River Derwent.Further flood prevention work was carried out in April which involved lifting an additional 100 2-tonne rock-filled bags by a large crane situated on the A6 into the River Derwent to reduce erosion and limit damage to an Environment Agency flood wall that sits next to the privately owned wall that has collapsed.At the same time, a survey team gathered valuable geological information to inform the longer-term engineering solution.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 9 May 2022        Related content      Business rates information letter 11/2012Business rates information letter 4/2012Insolvency Statistics, April to June 2017Business rates information letter 7/20116/2017: rural rate relief and business rates relief schemesExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

Make a flood plan so when you get a flood warning, you know what to do.Buckfastleigh has a history of bad flooding. Flooding in 1979 hit 74 properties. Then in 2012 there were two separate floods, water rising to 1.2m in places. A flood alleviation scheme was built in 1988. Then in 2016 improvements were made to raise walls by the River Mardle in two places. However, flood risk cannot be eliminated which is why the town joins the flood warning service.Editor’s notesBuckfastleigh joined the flood warning system on 7 December 2022.The Dean Burn and River Mardle are also part of the Dartmoor Headwaters Pilot project involving tree planting, mire/peatland restoration, floodplain reconnect and flow attenuation measures. These watercourses will be a key part of the wider Headwaters natural flood management project moving forward.The Environment Agency encourages people to take three simple steps to become flood resilient:check your flood risk onlinesign up for flood warningsknow what to do if flooding hitsThe Environment Agency flood warning service reaches almost 50,000 new properties at risk of flooding and hopes to exceed its target to provide new warning capability for 62,000 properties at risk of flooding by this winter. It brings the number of properties registered with the service to 1.6 million.Flood warnings tell people about an imminent risk of flooding to their home or business and help people make informed decisions about how to respond. There are three types of warning – flood alert, flood warning and severe flood warning. Each warning type is triggered by weather, river or sea conditions which cause flooding.Householders are encouraged to prepare if they receive a flood alert which could mean packing a bag that includes medicines, insurance documents and anything else they wouldn’t want to lose if flooding were to take place. A flood warning calls on people to act now which means turning off gas, water and electricity and moving family and pets to safety. A severe flood warning means you are in immediate danger and to follow advice from emergency services.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 12 December 2022Explore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

It means the Environment Agency can ask Yorkshire Water to slow the flow of water leaving the reservoir to manage habitats and river flows to protect wildlife. The flow from the reservoir will reduce from 2million litres per day to 1million litres.The order will have no impact on the public water supply as the Holme Styes Reservoir is a historic mill reservoir and not part of the public water infrastructure.Victoria Slingsby, environment planning and engagement manager for the Environment Agency in Yorkshire, said:We’re pleased the drought order request we submitted for Holme Styes reservoir has been approved, which means we can reduce the flow from the reservoir to protect habitats and wildlife. Without it, the reservoir could run dry and plants and animals that rely on it would die.It’s an example of the action we are taking right across the country as the extreme temperatures increase the likelihood of local impacts and put pressure on the water environment and wildlife.The Environment Agency declared prolonged dry weather in Yorkshire on 13 July.Prolonged dry weather is a natural event which has become more likely with climate change. It occurs as a result of low rainfall for an extended period of time. Once prolonged dry weather is declared, actions are taken to minimise impacts on the environment.Action is being taken by Government, Environment Agency, water companies, environmental and angling groups and farmers to manage the impacts. For example, the Environment Agency is responding to environmental risks and increasing fisheries incident response, as well as operating a large number of augmentation and water transfer schemes.In Yorkshire, they have worked with holders of 128 abstraction licences to issue ‘hands off flow’ conditions, which means licence holders have been told that river levels are low and as a result abstraction must stop to protect the environment.July recorded the fifth month in a row of below average long term average rainfall for Yorkshire, with most of Yorkshire’s rivers in below normal flow conditions.If people see any environmental impacts due to dry weather, such as fish in distress, it should be reported to the Environment Agency 24/7 on 0800 80 70 60.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 12 August 2022Explore the topicDrought and water availabilityIs this page useful?

This will include planning for and enabling development that is truly inclusive and sustainable which delivers real benefits for our communities and environment now and in the future.The Arc already is home to over 2 million jobs and provides a place to live for over 3.7 million residents.The Arc’s success is key to the United Kingdom’s national prosperity, international competitiveness, and ability to meet the challenges and opportunities the country will face over the next century, including climate change and supporting nature recovery technological change fighting COVID-19 and preventing future pandemics.This regional success will build on the work of the government that has helped millions of people continue to provide for their families as part of its Plan for Jobs to protect, support and create employment.Further informationThe Oxford to Cambridge (OxCam) Arc the name given to a cross-government initiative that supports planning for the future made up of the five counties of Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. It includes:3 county councils: Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire.17 district councils: City of Oxford, South Oxfordshire, Vale of the White Horse,  West Oxfordshire, Cherwell, Northampton, South Northamptonshire,Daventry, Wellingborough, Kettering, Corby, East Northamptonshire, City of Cambridge, South Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Fenland and East Cambridgeshire;6 unitary authorities: Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes, Luton, Bedford, Central Bedfordshire and City of Peterborough;Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority.The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is a unique place, home to cutting-edge research, globally renowned science, and technology clusters, and some of the most productive towns and cities in the country.Oxford and Cambridge are world-leading centres of research and innovation. There are 10 significant higher education institutions, including Cranfield University, with its world-leading specialisms in automotive and aerospace engineering, the Open University, and the world-leading centres of learning at the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge.The Arc contains a vibrant natural environment and a rich cultural heritage, and it is home to some of the country’s fastest growing and most innovative places.Cambridge’s rate of patent applications – a key indicator of innovation – is the highest in the UK, at over 12 times the national average. Milton Keynes is the fastest growing city in the country. Work on the COVID-19 vaccine, testing and treatment is the latest example of the Arc’s unique innovation and business environment leading efforts to tackle a global challenge.The Arc already is home to over 2 million jobs and provides a place to live for over 3.7 million residents.With the right interventions and investment, local economic forecasts suggest that by 2050 we would see economic output doubling to over £200 billion.  The Arc’s success is key to the UK’s national prosperity, international competitiveness, and ability to meet the challenges and opportunities we will face as a country over the next century, including climate change and supporting nature recovery, technological change, fighting COVID-19 and preventing future pandemics.“The Arc” offers a significant opportunity for the government and partners to work together to support the harmonious delivery of improved connectivity, productivity and place-making, whilst ensuring pioneering environmental standards and enhancements are delivered and the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan is put into action.The desirability of the Arc as a place to live, visit, work and invest is in part due to the quality of the local environment, the rich and diverse character of its landscapes, and the resultant high value of the area’s natural capital.Spatial frameworkThe spatial framework will set a plan and policies with the status of national planning policy. Based on a long-term, strategic approach to planning for growth across the area, it will help to unlock the long-term potential of the area in a sustainable way, improving the Arc as a place to live and work. It will give communities a chance to shape the long-term future of their area and will help to ensure the benefits of growth are felt across the region.We are today publishing a policy paper, which sets out the approach we intend to take, including:a timeline for developing the framework,how we will engage communities and work with local partners, andthe high-level scope of the framework, including the approach it will take to planning for the environment, infrastructure, economic growth, and new homes and place-making.Growth bodyCapitalising on the globally renowned assets of the Oxford-Cambridge Arc can help to lead the UK’s economic recovery. That is why government has today (18 February) announced its intent to establish a Growth Body in the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.This will give a clear economic leadership voice to the Arc. This announcement builds on government’s support for the region including connecting communities through East West Rail and supporting a long-term plan for sustainable growth with the spatial framework.Government will work with local partners to ensure that the Growth Body is tailored to the region’s unique opportunities.Media enquiriesEmailnewsdesk@communities.gov.ukPlease use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office          0303 444 1209        Office address and general enquiries2 Marsham StreetLondonSW1P 4DFEmailcorrespondence@communities.gov.ukGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public          030 3444 0000        If your enquiry is related to COVID-19 please check our guidance page first before you contact us - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government.If you still need to contact us please use the contact form above to get in touch, because of coronavirus (COVID-19).

The breach in the redundant flood bank, allowing tidal water from the estuary to flow in and out of the creeks has enabled this new vital intertidal habitat to establish in front of the new flood banks.The old flood bank is a popular footpath, and the Environment Agency has supported the Tamar Community Trust in getting a new footbridge to maintain access along the river. The footpath is due to open shortly, following completion of work to ensure the safety of users.Andy Rogers, Local Project Lead for the Environment Agency, said:We really appreciate the efforts that the local community, Tamar Community Trust and Calstock Parish Council have made in helping make the Calstock intertidal habitat and flood defence improvement scheme possible.The Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) team has played a key role making sure the best outcome is delivered for the community, and we are thankful for the support of Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Cornwall Bird Watching Preservation Society and Calstock Footpath Society.The scheme has also made the field next to the football pitch available to the Tamar Community Trust so it can be managed to the benefit of the local community.Last year the Environment Agency was a key partner in a similar project with the National Trust to create a new 1.7-hectare intertidal habitat at Cotehele on the Tamar.Rob Price, Tamar Catchment Coordinator at the Environment Agency, said:The creation of new intertidal habitat on the Tamar at Cotehele and now this work at Calstock reinforces our aims to improve resilience to the changing climate and to provide a richer environment for people and nature.It will provide an invaluable tool in the fight against climate change by locking in carbon and also help improve overall water quality.  This valuable work is an important part of an integrated programme of works to build the Tamar catchment’s resilience to a wide range of environmental pressures including those related to biodiversity and a changing climate.The project is being funded by Flood Defence Grant in aid, Water Environment Investment Fund, and contributions from the Tamar Community Trust.Notes to editorsIt is clear that we are already seeing the impacts of climate change in the UK and around the world, which is why urgent action is needed to adapt the impacts of climate emergency at the same time as reducing emissions.We’re already seeing the impacts of the climate emergency in the UK.According to the Met Office 2020 was the third warmest, fifth wettest and eight sunniest on record for the UK. No other year has yielded observations that fall in the top-ten for all three of these variables for the UK.That included the wettest ever February, where most of the UK received more than twice the February long-term average rainfall, with 300% quite widely in the north and west, and over 400% in parts of the Pennines.Climate change is happening now. We’re seeing more extreme weather, with an increase in flooding, coastal erosion and landslips. The most recent climate change predictions confirm we will experience wetter winters and drier summers, with an increased likelihood of more intense rainfall leading to flooding.We’re working to better protect communities from this risk, with climate change projection built into the design of flood defences to ensure they are fit for the future.However the climate emergency means that we cannot always prevent or build our way out of an incident. That’s why we’re working to help households, businesses and communities be better prepared and more resilient to flooding and coastal change through our long term FCERM strategy, and making sure that people have access to the information they need to prepare, act, survive.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 19 April 2022        Related content      Passenger experience of rail disruption handling in Great BritainLondon Midland ticket office opening hours decisionPassenger views on rail fares and pricing in Great BritainDisabled Person’s Railcard (DPRC) and assisted journeys data: 1 Apr 2021 to 24 July 2021 (Periods 1-4)Railway stationsExplore the topicRiver maintenance, flooding and coastal erosionIs this page useful?

It will also create 2 hectares of enhanced riverside habitat for the benefit of wildlife, remove obstructions to allow fish migration to continue upstream and create 13 hectares of high quality public open space. Another benefit will be enhanced foot and cycle paths that benefit residents and visitors.The Salisbury River Park project is a collaboration between the Environment Agency, Wiltshire Council, Salisbury City Council and Swindon and Wiltshire Local Enterprise Partnership.In the initial stages of work, the River Avon channel in the Central Car Park will be dewatered to enable work to start in the river channel. Excavation work will also start in Central Car Park and Fisherton Recreation Ground. A temporary play area will be built in Ashley Road Open Space. Foundation works will also commence at Ashley Road for the construction of a flood defence wall.Works will also start this month to relocate the allotment shop on Fisherton Recreation Ground. This is initially being moved into some temporary buildings at Fisherton Farm allotments on the opposite side of Fisherton Recreation Ground, until a decision is made on a more permanent building. This will involve the existing gate entrance being widened to allow the buildings to be delivered.The scheme will better protect homes and businesses from flooding and improve the environmentOnce the allotment shop has been relocated, Salisbury City Council will repurpose the allotment shop and existing toilets into a concession stand and fully accessible toilets, which will include baby change facilities and a changing places toilet (which provides a changing bench, hoist and enough space for a carer). This investment will provide facilities that will ensure that every member of our community can enjoy the new River Park when completed.The works will continue to impact on Central Car Park as parking spaces will be temporarily removed to allow space for a site compound and to ensure public safety. Several footpaths and cycle paths will be diverted, where they are adjacent to the works, and reopened whenever it is safe to do so. Diversions will be clearly marked and staff will be on site to provide assistance. The scheme, once completed, will provide major improvements to the footpaths and cycle paths in the area.Ron Curtis, Area Flood and Coastal Risk Manager at The Environment Agency said:The start of construction is a really important milestone for the Salisbury River Park. This is the first step in providing better flood protection for the city.We know the devastating impact that flooding can have, which is why protecting people and communities is our top priority. Working with our partners we’re really excited about the added benefits this scheme will bring for people and wildlife in Salisbury.Cllr Dr Mark McClelland, Cabinet Member for Transport, Waste, Street Scene and Flooding, Wiltshire Council, said:It’s great news that works have started on this exciting project. Creating sustainable environments is a priority within Wiltshire Council’s Business Plan and the Salisbury River Park project fully embraces the delivery of this aim.I’m really excited to see this project take shape and provide a lasting legacy for future generations.Artist's impression of the completed Salisbury River ParkCllr Annie Riddle said:Salisbury City Council are delighted to see this next phase of works begin which will show the exciting transformational work of this project – enhancing the environment but also providing a delightful area for our residents and visitors to enjoy one of Salisbury’s great river assets.Paddy Bradley, CEO Swindon and Wiltshire Local Enterprise Partnership, said:This exciting and necessary initiative is a wonderful way to protect the beautiful and historic city of Salisbury. In addition to ensuring 350 homes and businesses are saved from the trauma and disruption of flooding, the scheme will also plant 600 trees, reinvigorate the area’s wildlife habitat as well as opening up further cycle and foot paths. The overall aesthetics of the area will be improved and undoubtedly encourage greater tourism, which in turn, will assist with the economic recovery and growth of the city.It is anticipated that the main construction works will be completed in spring 2024.Further information on the project can be found at www.salisburyriverparkphase1.comThe main contractor for the scheme, Kier, will have staff available on site, including a Public Liaison Officer – Chloe Hulbert. Chloe can be contacted with any queries on the ongoing works on 07731 981810 or chloe.hulbert@kier.co.uk.

The dry weather causes low flows and together with higher temperatures, this encourages the vegetation to grow.The Environment Agency has been trialling different techniques to remove the weed to create some refuge areas for the fish. This improves the dissolved oxygen levels in the water, which the fish depend on.Officers recently went out in a boat and used a boom to gather the duck weed, then a digger to scoop the aquatic plant out of the river. The work was carried out over a week at the end of July and more is planned.A mound of duck weed and azolla weed removed from the riverBen Norrington, fisheries officer in East Anglia, said:We are clearing the surface weed proactively to avoid any incident that could arise from having this vegetation and impact the water quality.As temperatures warm up, the surface weed sucks the oxygen out of the water. Then we have thunder storms, which lowers the temperature again. High temperature water mixed with low temperature rain can cause an oxygen crash and that’s what will kill the fish.The duck weed remaining has been thinned out meaning the sun and rain can break through, which will improve the levels of oxygen in the water.The officers have also carried out duck removal on the River Bret, the River Gipping and on Lady Island in Sudbury.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 19 August 2019        Related content      Drug Licensing Handling Fee guidancePrecursor chemicals wallchart for domestic licensingAnti-knife crime community fund: successful bids for 2018 to 2019Anti-knife crime community fund - year 3 (2019 to 2020)Explore the topicBiodiversity and ecosystemsIs this page useful?

Prior to October last year, abstractors were exempt from the need to hold licences to abstract. But in response to the passing of the Isles of Scilly (Application of Water Legislation) Order 2020 last year, SWW submitted applications for their public water supply abstractions.Following a detailed assessment of the applications, the Environment Agency has this month issued 6 licences to SWW, covering abstractions from 21 wells and boreholes across the islands.Determining the licences for these historic wells and boreholes has been a lengthy process. Whilst determining the licences the Environment Agency has been assessing the risks of the abstractions upon the islands’ nationally and internationally designated sites – including 7 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Area of Conservation, a Special Protection area, Ramsar and Marine Conservation Zone, as well as risks to private borehole abstractions.A condition of the licences has been the agreement between Environment Agency, SWW, Natural England and the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust that environmental monitoring takes place to improve our understanding of the risks of the now licensed abstractions on the designated sites.Mark Pilcher, from the Environment Agency, said:“We have been working hard with Defra over the last decade to apply mainland environmental legislation across to the Isles of Scilly to ensure that the fragile and highly sensitive environment is protected.“The islands have vulnerable and limited groundwater supplies, so having the ability to now licence and regulate abstraction is an essential part of supporting sustainability on the islands for people and wildlife.“Issuing these licences is a significant milestone. For the first time we will have appropriate regulatory tools to ensure that groundwater abstraction on the islands remains balanced and well managed”.Rob Scarrott, Head of Water Resources and Water Efficiency at South West Water, said:“Securing licences for abstraction and desalination is a significant step in safeguarding water supply and the environment of the Isles of Scilly. As part of the new agreement, sites of groundwater abstraction will be strictly monitored to ensure there is no impact on the natural environment.“South West Water, the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust have worked hard to understand the potential challenges and to secure the best outcome for the Islands.”Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 5 October 2021Explore the topicAbstract (take) waterIs this page useful?

The work is part of the Environment Agency’s North East crackdown called Operation Creel that aims to protect species threatened by our changing climate; the white clawed crayfish and European eel.Members of the public have reported illegal practices including crayfish trapping and fish theft, particularly in the River Skerne and nearby ponds, adding to other sources of intelligence and helping authorities to track the culprits.Traps can prove deadly for river mammals including otters who may get stuck and drown after following prey.Native white clawed crayfish are in decline in the North East due to invasive American signal crayfish. The American species is bigger and takes over habitat while also carrying a disease deadly to their native counterparts.David Shears, Environment Agency Senior Fisheries Enforcement Officer, said:“I’d like to urge people to contact the Environment Agency if they witness any signs of illegal activity.“Climate change is putting many of our native species at risk and we need to protect habitats where they thrive.“It’s a serious crime to set these hazardous traps and horrific to see evidence of otters having drowned, as well as the other ecological impacts we risk. We are on the ground, remaining vigilant and will act on all intelligence we receive.”Councillor Andy Keir, Darlington Borough Council’s cabinet member for local services, said:“We’re happy to continue to support the work of the Environment Agency’s enforcement officers in tackling illegal fishing and would urge anyone with information to pass it on to the Environment Agency.”Traps used to take fish in England must be authorised by the Environment Agency and be safe for other wildlife. Because of the populations of rare native crayfish in the area, traps are rarely authorised other than for scientific reasons. Anyone who fishes must also have the permission of the landowner.People fishing illegally or using illegal traps can expect to be prosecuted and face a substantial fine. Everyone can play their part, by reporting any illegal activity to the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60 or to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.Share this page      Sharing will open the page in a new tab                   Share on                    Facebook                      (opens in new tab)                         Share on                    Twitter                      (opens in new tab)              Published 24 November 2021        Related content      SK22 2NP, Mr Mel Cranmer and 3 others: environmental permit application advertisement - EPR/WB3093EA/A001CM1 7TG, Mr William Marriage and Mrs Wendy Marriage: environmental permit application advertisement - EPR/VB3091NJ/A001Forms directions for patents, designs and trade marks ActsBiosafety unitNN10 0SQ, Bedfordia Farms Limited: environmental permit issued - EPR/AP3237RR/V003Explore the topicWildlife and habitat conservationIs this page useful?
